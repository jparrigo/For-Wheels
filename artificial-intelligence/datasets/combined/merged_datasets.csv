0, on 07/28/10 07:30 AM (PDT),Bob ,2010 Acura ZDX Hatchback Advance Package 4dr Hatchback AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),This is truly a driver's car," I love the fact that with SH-AWD the more gas you give it the better it hugs the turns. You really can feel it working and shuffling power around as needed when driving enthusiastically. I spent a few weeks with it in the snow and actually tried to make the tires slip by jumping on the gas. All the electronics went to work and I briskly took off with no drama.  The ZDX easily has one of the best interiors of any vehicle in its price range or even above it, and with the advance package you get the adjustable shocks to smooth things out when the wife is in the car. Switching from Comfort to Sport mode feels like going from a Lexus RX to a BMW X5 but with even better handling.

2, on 12/26/16 18:08 PM (PST),Scott ,2017 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),So far so good.," UPDATE 12/27/17 - after owning this car for 13 months and 12k miles, nothing has changed. Basic maintenance and same comfort and performance. My only minor complaint is the passenger window occasionally goes down about a half inch on its own. I notice because it rattles. I don't know why it dies this- almost like road bumps rattle it loose. I switch between regular and premium gas and notice no difference in mpg. Car feels like it runs better on premium but not enough to justify the 70 cents + per gallon difference. Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.",4.0,Acura,MDX,2017,gasoline,290.0,6,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,26,19,204,56400,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2017 Acura MDX 4dr SUV AWD (6cyl)

Like the kool wheels. This car is nice. Except it needs a keyless entry and ignition.  Acura really dropped the ball here.  Most luxury cars in year 2012 have this feature.

Ive been assured it is indeed genuine leather, but gee, not like the leather they used to put on cars!Glad i got the 6 sp standard transmission, fun to drive.   Trunk space seems small, compared to Honda accord.  Also, no pass thru from trunk, into rear seats.   Other features are ok.   But for the price, Acura dropped the ball on a few key items.  Hate the sight lines- we had to remove rear head rests to better view put the back. The car sits low and it is hard to see outnthe windows. Honda Accord and CRV had far superior sight lines.  Also, arm rest does not extend far enough for driver to rest arm on it while driving- bad design.  Why is gear knob covered in metal? This gets too hot in smmer sun, and too cold in winter freeze, making it v uncomfortable to touch, 80% of time-- Bad design, again. We switched it out for a leather gear shift cover.  C'mon Acura, devil is in the  details.    Acura missed the boat in several areas of detail on this car!Also, im NOT USING PREMIUM GAS, despite the recommendation by Acura to do so.

After all, it's a sensitive transmission.  What a piece of junk.  It's a hard ride and very noisy as well.  They cut every corner they could on this car and it shows.  They didn't cut the price either.  What is standard options on so many other cars now, you pay dearly for on an Acura.  I will never, ever purchase another Acura.

You can only dial numbers that are stored in your speed dial other than that you are having to use your phone to dial numbers. While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn't have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn't make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be. I feel as though for this car to be as expensive as it is that this Siri radio should have come along with it. But no it's a basic radio station with speakers that are not loud at all and there's no touchscreen to do anything. This is by far the worst car I've bought and wish I would have kept my Hyundai Elantra which features on the inside were so much better than this Acura and I paid 10 - 15 G less. I've contacted Acura numerous of times with only to be told that this will go in a file for my complaints. I sure wish  they would give me another car with the features that are  basic in other cars or buy this one back. This is a $30,000 car and I am so disappointed in it . I advised them that I would sell them this car back in a heartbeat and now I'm stuck with an expensive car with basic features and a High car payment. So definitely think twice about buying the ILX because you will really be disappointed in the features that they offer you in such an expensive body.Review: nothing has changed for the better. No room in car and I've almost received ticket due to having my phone in hand for trying to make a phone call because the Calling system in the car is poorly done.

It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse Over al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars.

37, on 03/17/16 21:54 PM (PDT),bob ,2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe 2dr Coupe (1.7L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"If you like 80's exotics, this car is for you."," It's been said before -- this car is not for everyone.  But, if you love driving a light, tight, awesome looking, sensory overkill fast sports car, this is your vehicle.  The 4c is unlike anything else on the road today -- and thank heavens for it.  Now, if you want comfort, quiet, listening to your tunes while drinking a latte, and wanting to be unseen when puttering around town, then this is not your car.  Enjoy your Lexus.Pros:  Just a blast to drive.  Its ""honest"" which in itself is unique today.  Nothing is covered up or added simply to fool anyone.  It's the real deal, not fake.  It's exciting, refreshing and unlike any other car made today.  It's obviously hand built and fit and finish is better than most exotics. The beautiful carbon fibre interior will make your eyes water every time you look inside.   The noise from the turbo charger waste gates will make you laugh out loud. It sounds a like 80's rally cars and seems to go like one as well.  Performance is more than fine for city streets.  You can floor it and run it through the gears without being tossed in jail.  The F1 style gearbox works remarkably well -- better than a Ferrari F430.What's also surprised me is how reliable it has been.  In a year of ownership, not one thing has gone wrong.   To say I was expecting something different is an understatement.And the car is just beautiful, along with being completely unique. If you want people to look at you, buy this car.  Between the noise and the looks you'll be a rock star on the boulevard.  Service is also very reasonable.  Yearly service on the car is only $240.  Try that in a Ferrari or Lamborghini.Cons:  Ok, it's noisy,  And the wide body and doors do make it difficult to park in a normal parking space.  And it's a pain to get in and out of.  And it's a bit difficult to see out the back of. And the trunk is ridiculously small.  And the trunk latch is in a silly place.  And the seats are tight. And the seats don't move a lot. And the seat belt warning buzzer is annoying.  And it has no GPS. And the seat belts rub against your neck.  And there's no glove box.  And there's these silly wires coming out from under the dash to charge your phone.  And the cup holders don't hold larger drinks. And it has some turbo lag. And if you want to put things in the trunk, you have to put them on the ground first because you need both hands to open and latch the rear lid. And it has no power steering so parking can require some actual muscle use.  And if you're over 6 foot 3 you're going to say it's too small.  And if you're too wide the seats are going to be uncomfortable.  And it doesn't come with a manual gearbox.  And there's no climate control. And the Parrot radio is a complete joke.So if the Cons have turned you off by now, then you know this car is not for you.  But if you love the idea of driving an 80's exotic with all of it's drama, feel, personality and looks BUT with AC and brakes that actually work in a car that doesn't fall apart before your eyes and is reasonably affordable to own, then this car is for you.I personally love it.  You can thrash it unlike you can other more expensive sports cars and it only costs about the same as the 10,000 Corvette C7's you see everyday.Thank heavens for Alfa Romeo. Someone was nutty enough to make a car a real drivers car today that doesn't seem like every other car you drive.

The 3.2 Cab is a great car to drive. I've had Porsche and BMW convertibles and nothing can compare to the amazing roof this Audi has. It's canvas, but virtually silent even when driving at 80 mph. I don't know how the engineers did it, but wind noise is kept at a minimum. Handling is much better than the old cabs. It seems stiffer and the turn-in is quicker. Brakes are awesome and inspire confidence. Got it in Alpaka Beige, cream interior and tan room. It's a very nice looking car, even with the new Audi gap-mouth grille.

After driving it I was very impressed, and traded my 2011 Corvette Grand Sport for the RS immediately. The RS has acceleration equal to the Corvette's up to about 80 mph, is far more maneuverable, and much more exciting to drive. It probably would not be at its best on long road trips however, since the ride is somewhat stiff and the exhaust noise can be bothersome. I have also owned a Porsche Cayman S in the recent past, and the Audi is superior to that car in nearly every respect. Any prospective Cayman buyer should give the Audi serious consideration. However, after six months of ownership, the check engine light came on. Due to the rarity of the vehicle and its sophisticated engine, it took two weeks for my dealer to find and fix the problem. I decided that I didn't want a car that had the potential to cause me further problems, so I traded it for a Porsche Boxster.",5.0,Audi,TT RS,2012,gasoline,360.0,5,MANUAL,AWD,2,Compact,Coupe,25,18,3105,56850,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,2012 Audi TT RS 2dr Coupe AWD (5cyl)

I do a lot of city driving, but even with my light foot and tendency to use Eco Pro, I am averaging 17.2 MPG. I have had SUVs that did better than that with bigger engines. The engine is very gruff at higher revs, and sounds like a diesel with all of that clatter. I do like the large moonroof and Harmon Kardon sound system. The trunk is nicely finished and very large. When I'm driving, I notice that my knees hit nothing but hard plastic or wood. It is very annoying, and for this price, I would expect a better designed interior. The rear seat has limited head room. I also noticed how loud it is on the freeway or in neighborhoods. At cruising speeds, I can barely hold a conversation with my rear passengers due to the wind and road noise. I regret getting the M Sport because it rides rougher and I am tired of it. I love the latest version of iDrive. The front seats aren't very accommodating.

The sunroof won't close from vent, the engine leaks oil and burns it due to crap valve stem seals.  The control arm bushings die every 60K miles depending on the road conditions.  The heater valve has failed, the engine bay rain tray craps out.  The oil seals around the alternator bracket fail.  Lots of poorly made parts that are like $5 but cost $1000s in labor to replace fail.  These cars are garbage reliability, only buy one if its low miles, or you plan to wrench it yourself.

Keep in mind that this is big vehicle so quick is a relative, but in true BMW fashion the car will get you up to 80mph+ without you even being aware even in city traffic. However, there is a noticeable lag from the turbo and gas mileage borders on atrocious for this day and age when driven even just modestly aggressive.  With that said, it's quiet and smooth at speeds of even over 100mph. The I-Drive is far better than the old days and better than any I've used. Also, the rear seats fold down which increases the utility greatly and was one of the reason I decided to buy this model. The interior quality is among the best, although taller drivers and passengers will need to watch their heads as the car is low and wide both inside and out.So you get a gorgeous car, room for large items in the back (especially with the rear seats folded) as well as a wonderful touring car with front seats that will make your time in the car very comfy. All this for a mere $90K or so....  And that's where the rub is for me. Despite being treated with the M badging and upgraded package, my in line 6 cylinder still lacks fairly basic items like blind spot detection, intuitive cruise control, lane keep, upgraded stereo and the one that drives me crazy, a power trunk. The power trunk is not even an option, but adding these other items along with the accompanying, required packages and you're approaching $100K. In addition, I had to pay extra via aftermarket hack to have simple things like mirrors fold with remote, windows down with remote, auto engine shutoff disabled. Seems to me that even for the messily $87K that my car cost new it should really have these items. I am pretty sure the same year Honda Accord has more amenities. I mean, come on BMW.

I bought this 2013 128i used, having previously owned a 2004 330ci for 6 years. Granted, the 330ci had Premium package and the 128i is base. But the Sensatech seats and door material on the 128i look cheap, and the black shiny plastic in place of the wood grain or titanium trim is just plain tacky. The 330ci felt like a luxury vehicle. The 128i feels like an entry-level Hyundai or something. I actually just sold a Hyundai Genesis 2.0T Premium, which had keyless entry, keyless start, universal remote, moonroof, nice trim, automatic dimming mirrors and good bolstered seats. It cost about $24k new. The base 128i has NONE of those things, and cost over $33k new. Yes, the driveability is much better than a Genesis (but noticeably worse than a 330ci). The gas mileage is worse than both of these other vehicles.  Overall I'm not overly impressed with the 1 series. It feels like a step down (even with more power than the 330ci and the Genesis) and a step backwards in time.

BEWARE!!!," My husband and I purchased a 2006 BMW 760i from BMW of West Springfield dealership back in August 2014.  We purchased it as our 3rd vehicle, so we drove it mostly on the weekends.  When I got rid of my vehicle a few months later, it was driven on a regular basis.  We started noticing issues with the transmission shifting back into ""Park"" when we would shift it into ""Drive"".  This began happening about 5 months after having the car.  Now, it never shifted while the car was moving.  It was only when we started the car or had parked it but didn't shut it off .  Definitely not a good situation to be in if you had somewhere you needed to be- I don't know- maybe WORK.  It wasn't a risk we were willing to take, especially if we had our children in the car.  We took it to the BMW dealership- where we purchased it from.  They told us that all the fluids looked good and that after much inspection the car would need a new transmission (about $10,000 cost).  So we got a second opinion and they noticed that we were extremely low on transmission fluid- which was odd since the dealership told us that all of our fluid levels were good.  Long story short, we did in fact need a new transmission.  We replaced it with a used one (about $5,000 cost) and the car was fine for about two months.  After that, the same problems began again and we got rid of the car.  BEWARE!  We thought we were ok because we got the car from the BMW dealership but that means NOTHING.  They wanted to get rid of the car themselves and I believe they knew something was wrong with it.  I should have contacted the Attorney General but didn't want to be bothered with the hassle.  Now I wish I had because now our same car is on sale for almost $15,000 down in Marlyand and it's not even worth $10,000 at this point!  Please be careful with the 2006 BMW 7 series!

AND I am not a car nut. I really like this car.  We bought ours used in Colorado for $16K. It had 92,000 miles on it. I had it inspected by a BMW dealership for about $300. They tore through it and found some issues. The electronic cable sleeve between the computer and the transmission. It typically leaks every 100K. It was leaking.  The shocks were bad. And the coolant system had a leak. I bought the car after some further negotiations.  It was in the shop quickly for a radiator replacement, a lower radiator supply hose, a worn out wheel bearing, shocks, and new tires.  That was about $3000.  We had about $19k into this car with 105,000 miles on it.  Regret started to sink into our minds.  But since then the car has just had maintenance visits.  I replaced the coil over ignition plugs at 180,000(they lasted 80k more than BMW says they should). I changed the oil every 7k, it does eat 1 qt of oil every 7000 miles. I just deal with that.  I put continental contipro contact tires on it. This car powers through corners now. It drives through 12"" of snow and heavy rains with NO problems.  Folks this car is reliable if you take care of it. The car must go to a great mechanic who knows BMW's.  Don't skimp on non-OEM parts.  Go to Bavarian autosport for parts if you want to DYI the repairs.  The car may the basic 6 buts fast. So fast.  Faster than our 2009 BMW X5 with the turbo diesel.

Took the car to a certified BMW repair facility and was told it was a fuel pump, and or possibly fuel relay. Cost $1500 to  replace both components. I declined bought both parts offline and put them in ($300). Problem was it didn't fix the car so back on the wrecker it went. (Did I mention Car spends lots of time on a wrecker). New shop new diagnosis, bad DMI Board. The DMI board fixed the problem. Nothing on these cars are cheap to fix, this repair with reprogramming was $1300.00. All was good for about 2 weeks and the car literally quit running at 50 MPH  (no power steering -no brakes to speak of)  Again on the wrecker it went. Diagnosis bad battery and programming issues. Ok, a Battery no big deal $240 for the battery $100.00 to program it (No, you can't just swap batteries in newer BMWs ) and of course $100 to put battery in (Labor) so  roughly $450.00 for a new battery. All was good for about 3 months. The car was excellent in the snow a pleasure to drive. performance unequaled to anything else I've owned.  Gas mileage is excellent fora performance car. I'm thinking finally got the bugs out of it,really enjoying it AND BAM total shutdown AGAIN at 45 MPH. On the wrecker again 3rd time in less than 7months. Diagnosis the computer decided it didn't want to talk to the car. To fix the car needs to be completely reprogrammed another $500 with towing. The repair shop did tell me though BMW is aware of cars losing communication with the ECU. (service Bulletin) They seem to be aware of a lot of the problems their  cars have. They like the word ""service bulletin"" basically we have a problem(s) with such and such, but you will have to pay to have it fixed.

The only things I  dislike is when I  use 3rd gear to go down a very large hill near my home. It doesn't hold well and I  need to use my brake too much. My Mazada held much better on the downhill. There is a Blindspot, as in most cars, with trim alongside front windshield.  Could use more safety features. That was the only thing I  really missed when shifting from Mazda6 to Buick Cascada. Would have loved the auto braking and also better monitoring for highway driving, even if just in the side view mirrors. Back up camera picture could be sharper images. Love the parking assist, crash warning and also the cross center line warning...this is a very good thing with distracted driving at its peak these days. All in all, I  had to have this mid sized convertible. Can't  and won't  do the little verts due to dangerous road conditions, mostly other drivers, and after driving an audi convertible, I  wanted another vert but not that price, and mid sized for sure. Love it, however, when putting other b.boomers in back....forget it. All complaints. So, save the back seat for the young agile people!  Maybe offer in a 4 door?

Updated 11/16," Our new Deep Sky Blue Cascada replaces our faithful old Chrysler Sebring JXI.  My wife loves convertibles and this car is a nice one.  So far she has logged just a few hundred miles but they have been surprisingly enjoyable.  The turbo 4 has better then expected performance and the handling is crisp.  Not a floaty ride like Buick's of yore.  Much has been made of all of the buttons on the dash, but most are only used occassionally and you quickly get used to the layout.  The seats are comfortable and the convertible top, and it's mechanism, are awesome.  So far we haven't found  much not to like about this car.  Styling is extremely attractive from every angle and the car gets a lot of compliments.  At $37K, the price seems reasonable for what you get.  Our old Sebring listed at $27k when new back in 2000, and it is no where near as well equipped.  The car has some nice Euorpean touches, like the redundant set of tail lights when the trunk is open and the side signal lights on the front fenders. As for fuel economy, we recently averaged 28.6 mpg on a day trip here the DIC showed an average speed of 46 mph city/highway.  We are looking forward to enjoyable summer driving with this car.Update:  November, 2016 -  Enjoyable summer with the Cascada.  Fun car to drive.

256, on 12/08/16 09:22 AM (PST),John ,2017 Cadillac XT5 SUV Luxury 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Thoughts from an SRX driver," I took my SRX in for warranty work and was given the XT5 AWD as a loaner for one day.  Here is my thoughts based on the 55 miles I put on it. The XT5 is similar to my 4-month-old SRX in terms of pricing and trim level. However, the XT5 is very different in the following ways. Engine: newer engine with auto-start-stop function and a newer transmission.  Secondly, I noticed right away that the led lights are standard and the headlights are not halogen like the similar trim SRX. The XT5 does have the auto start/stop where the engine could be automatically turned off at a red light (by the software). When you step on the gas pedal, the engines turns back on. The car, also, switches between V6 and V4 mode depending on the power needs, similar to Honda's VCM technology. The ride is quiet, smooth, and sure-footed. However, I did feel that the SRX's engine delivers quick power when demanded while the XT5's engine has to figure out how much power the driver needs before delivering it.  So there is a brief lag time since the software has to decide between different modes (V6 vs V4) to deliver power. On the positive note, the XT5 is very fuel efficient compared to the SRX. The nagging windspeed noise originating from the panoramic roof on the SRX seems to have been resolved. The placement of several buttons on the SRX, such as parking brake or Onstar, have been moved around. So there will be a learning curve for the SRX drivers when they upgrade to the XT5. Most importantly, several ""digital"" buttons on the SRX's CUE (ex. such as heated seat button) have been replaced with actual buttons on the newer model. The CUE seems to be more responsive on this upgraded model but there is still a decent amount of time needed to learn it if you are not familiar with the system. The most important difference is the new, redesigned seats.  They are more comfortable than the SRX's seats. My XT5 did come with collision warning, cross traffic alerts, and the seats do have a vibrate function to alert the driver of imminent dangers on the road. Finally, XT5 has a bigger interior and seems less heavy while driving when compared to the SRX. Overall, it is a decent improvement over the SRX. In other notes: if you have a larger family or require more space than the XT5 but cannot afford to break the bank trying to purchase an Escalade, my recommendation is to hold off till the XT7 comes out in 2018-19 timeframe.",5.0,Cadillac,XT5,2017,gasoline,310.0,6,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,26,18,1624,62500,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2017 Cadillac XT5 4dr SUV AWD (6cyl)

However, in this car I feel like a queen.  I really like the safety features that tell me that a car or pedestrian is approaching and from where.

CDs may be on the way out, but most of us still have favorite CDs.  It would be nice to be able to use them.  Also, I was disappointed that no spare tire (unless it is purchased as an addition) or donut was provided.  I only received a can of ""stuff"" to inflate my tire.

258, on 06/26/17 19:27 PM (PDT),Scott ,2017 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M),Don't own one quite yet," The ATS-V made my short list after exhaustively examining the car and talking extensively with the Cadillac product people at the LA and San Diego auto shows the last two years.  I like what I've read in all the reviews.  Last Friday Cadillac invited people who had indicated a previous interest in the brand to a driving/instructional event at Qualcomm stadium in San Diego.  After learning more about the features of the models and driving several cars under controlled conditions the ATS-V is now firmly at the top of my list for another car in 2018.  Corvette, Porsche 718 Cayman, and Audi TTS are now tied for second.  In an orchestrated but still pedal-to-the-floor straight line acceleration run to about 80 mph 464 HP, and then Brembo brakes, just took my breath away.  The 8-speed auto (in sport mode) snaps off shifts easily as well as a Porsche PDK.  I drove a regular ATS in a short mini autocross, too, and liked how that model performed.  I've read the criticism of the instrument cluster.  That's just going to be personal for everyone; it doesn't bother me.  Supposedly Cadillac is working on a better CUE for 2018.  The ATS-V is a real sleeper compared to the Corvette as it's arguably nearly the same car.  The back seat, however, is something that everyone will agree on.  It's uninhabitable for anyone over about 12 years old.  I'm only  5'11"" and there's no way to fit back there.  Fortunately, there's only my wife and me so I don't require a 4-seat car anyway.  But if you do, please heed my warning.  I've been doing 4 track days a year with my current car for a number of years now with AudiClub SoCal.  If my checkbook does indeed jump out of my pocket in 2018 I think this Cadillac ATS-V will acquit itself admirably at Buttonwillow, Spring Mountain, and Willow Springs.

I've owned 2 other Camaros (1990, 2010), 2 Mustangs and even a Corvette (2000), but nothing had the performance to make me fear for my life like this ZL1. It accelerates like a rocket, handles like it's on rails and stops on a dime so there's no real need to review the performance of the 6.2L supercharged engine. I mean, 580 hp and 556 lb/ft of torque speak for themselves. Were I so inclined I could cut the tires loose in almost any gear despite the traction control, however I don't make enough money to keep replacing them.Instead, I'm going to focus on the technology and aesthetic aspects of the car. First, the styling is gorgeous. Heads turn wherever we go, and once folks see the ZL1 script on the hood fingers begin pointing. Yes, it's difficult to see out of it when the top is up but I knew that going in. Besides, the top is rarely up. It's a summer time car and I use it as such. It gets appalling gas mileage; yes I said appalling. Roughly 12-14 mpg. But I wasn't buying a Prius, nor is this my daily driver so I'm ok with it. The infotainment system is decent and relatively easy to use once you've read the manual and played with it awhile, but the Boston Acoustics stereo is bad. Coming from a THX II Surround system in my Lincoln I am severely disappointed. I expected so much more. Sigh...The alcantara/leather seats and alcantara on the steering wheel/shift knob/dash are nice touches and make the interior stand out.

The performance of the Chevrolet never improved and Chevrolet never came out with a fix for the problem that I, and hundreds of others,  believe is the root of the poor performance of the  Silverado. What is most interesting is that, as I shopped the vehicle around, the Chevrolet dealers offered me the worst trade-in value for this vehicle.  I guess they knew something that I did not when I bought it!   By the way I took a significant beating on the trade-in value but it was worth it to me to get rid of this vehicle.  You will never see another General Motors product parked in my driveway !!!Due to a crash that left me a vehicle short, I jumped impulsively at the first and best deal I could find on a truck at the time and ended up with a new but year-old model Silverado 1500.  After only 500 miles, I took it back to the dealer and filed a complaint with GM because of the poor performance - hesitation, shuddering, low power during turns and climbing small hills, a feeling of constant transmission shifting dozens of times a minute, especially at speeds under 40 mph.  At highway speeds using cruise control, I could watch the RPM needle bounce up and down at 200-400 intervals.  I offered to trade it back to the dealer and purchase a higher priced 2500 with a different engine and transmission and even asked GM for trade assistance.   I tried to trade it on much higher priced trucks at other dealers and could not get more than 50% of the original sticker price with fewer than 1,000 miles and less than two months old.  Short answer after 4 months of phone calls - dealer didn't want it back and GM said this type of performance for their trucks was normal.  I am told by others who claim to know that the issue is the Active Fuel Management system that GM uses in trucks with the 5.3L engine and 6 speed transmission.  Internet reviews confirm others have experienced similar issues.  Between the poor performance, poor dealer support and non-existent GM support, this will be my Last Chevrolet Ever!",2.0,Chevrolet,Silverado 1500,2015,gasoline,355.0,8,AUTOMATIC,4WD,4,Large,Pickup,22,16,1385,46110,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 4dr Pickup 4WD (8cyl)

Dealer decided it must be the bushings and they replaced them, bad move bushings don't wear out in only months. Anyways, the fix didn't do very much. Turned it back in and they checked their TSB list that indicated to replace control arms. This was on their work order and receipt they gave me. For some reason they Instead decided to only torque control arms. Bad move. Still didnt fix it.

Compared to the Scion XA and Hyundai Accent, the Aveo felt roomier, more stylish, had more thoughful touches and in the case of the Accent, better built.  Chevy deserves credit for marketing this European-style hatch in America, where five-door hatches have been unpopular and dismissed as cheap throw-away cars.

This truck has all the upgrades ( Conv and luxury package, plus safety package )Ride is very nice, some sharp jolts on bad pavement.The one negative, the front seats are narrow, average comfort, but I love the heated feature, and that I can raise the seatTest drove the 2016 Toyota Tacoma, eliminated it, as there is no power seat option, and no way to raise or lower the seat. Too low of a seating positionI spent over a year looking at mid-size trucks, and the Colorado is #1 in my opinionUPDATE:  6-14-16- now have 12,000 miles on Colorado, no major problems, still love the truck.  One minor annoyance, and I hope Chevy fixes this in future updates, is the transmission.  It is geared to search for lowest gear ( to get better gas mileage), but it makes it tough when you need quick acceleration, it hesitates too much.  One thing I now do, is use the manual mode if I want the RPM""s up, as you can control what gear you are in.   As far as looks, I get an average of 3-4 people checking out the truck, people will stop me, and ask about it.  Definitely the best looking and unique truck in the market right now.UPDATE:  6-15-17- Now have 29,000 miles on my Colorado, no major or minor problems, still love the truck.  Chevy has updated the 2017 Colorado with a new 8 speed transmission.  This will eliminate the hesitation, I see on my 6 speed 2016.    I have added 2 new custom upgrades, I would recommend.  Cat back Muffler system ( $1,000) and a cold air intake air filter system ( $500 )  Both were dealer installed, so it keeps your warranty in place.  Gives better throaty sound, and I am getting half mpg better mileage. I was averaging 20.5, now I get 21, with mixed use driving.  Love it!UPDATE: 12-20-17 - Now have 37,000 miles on my Colorado, no problems at all, still love the truck.  Still getting 21 MPG overall, which is way better then I expected, since I have 4WD, and usually haul stuff around.  I have gotten used to the narrow seats, they do not bother me anymore.The only issue still, is the 6 speed transmission, it hesitates too long, before kicking in to a lower gear, when you need power quick.  Chevy did this to get better MPG, but is irritating when on freeway, and need power, you have to stomp on the accelerator!I also have been in the snow, and gone mudding in it, and it did great at both.  Still have people checking out the truck, no doubt best looking truck in market.           UPDATE: June 29th 2018:  Now have 43,000 miles, and no issues or problems.

I bought a Chrysler Pacifica because it was AWD.  My wife drove a 2003 Cavalier that she, apparently, loved.  I hated that thing -- it was low to the ground, had awful safety ratings, terrible reliability.  She was carting around the kids and her mother on shopping trips almost daily in a cramped compact.  I gave her the Pacifica because of the AWD (Northeast winters), the extreme level of comfort you can achieve with proper (frequent) maintenance, better safety rating and I took the Cavalier.  I couldn't stand it and drove it to a dealership 2 months later.  I bought a 2011 HHR in 2015.  Yes, I realize that the HHR is a glorified Cobalt which is a ""newer"" Cavalier.

The 2015 Chevy Cruze deserves an overall score of 8/10 stars due to the following evaluations: comfort-ability, performance, and design. Comfort-ability was seen throughout the interior of the sedan. Leather seats accompany the RS style of the sedan with adequate temperature control. Driver and passenger seat warmers are a nice feature—especially on cold winter mornings. The Chevy Cruze lacks in comfort for its seating design; the electronic seats are adjustable, but only to a certain extent. The seat leaves the driver’s head unsupported and situated at a very low level. With its robotic-like led fog lights to the superbly shaped front, the Chevy Cruze isn’t bad looking. However, its not a head turner by any means. The designers fell short with the back of the car, with no distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other sedans on the market. The front end doesn’t look aggressive, or challenging in anyway. The car reminds me of a derpy looking little brother compared to Chevy’s more sought after vehicles. All in all, for the average consumer the Chevy Cruze gets the job done. Performance surprised me, looking at the car you wouldn’t expect 0-60mph to be under 10 seconds. This car isn’t the next weekend drag racer you’d take up to Bandimere, but from point A to point B the torque developed is enough to keep you from feeling like your stuck in the stone age. The gearbox on the automatic transmission is what kills the fun in driving. Chevy needs to revamp its gear-point changes to deliver a smoother and faster response to the gear-shifts.

It was a steal!  Compared to the Honda, the Sonic feels like a big car wrapped in a small car body.  The interior is extremely quiet at all speeds and there's minimal wind, road, or engine noise that comes into the cabin.  The 1.8 liter isn't the fastest, but does fine getting up to speed, and hasn't ever felt slow.  The 5-speed's well-spaced gears certainly help and the shifter slips into gears easily.  The clutch is light and forgiving.  The ride is on the firm side, but pays off with pretty good handling and steering feel.  It doesn't match the Fiesta or Fit in that regard, but can still be a lot fun on a windy roadI love the design, and prefer it over the newer, more generic 2017 Sonic.  The exposed headlights, and circular theme within the tailights stand out from the crowd.  The same goes inside.  Many either love or hate the digital, motorcycle-inspired gauge cluster.  I personally love it; it's unique, quirky, easy to read, and being digital, makes staying at a certain speed a simple task.  The rest of the interior is also user friendly and straightforward.  Interior space upfront is generous and the footwell area has enough leg room for tall folks.  The rear seat doesn't match the Fit, but is still better than most small cars.  The trunk is pretty shallow with the seats up, but the hidden shelf below the load floor is clever, and there is loads of space if the seats are folded.  The seats are very comfortable and make long trips tolerable.Reliability has been good, and in one year and 3,000 miles, the only issue has been the carpet in the driver's footwheel started to bunch up.  It was replaced under warranty with no questions asked.  Is it perfect?  No.  The rear pillars are thick and there is a significant blind spot.  Some of the plastics inside are a little low-grade.But overall, it's a fantastic car.  It's a great value, built in America, has interesting style, and is a small car with few of the small car compromises.

Consider the following: 1. Did you know the Spark is actually a European design?  It has that European feel and no wonder - it is marketed in several European countries as an Opel “Karl”.  2.  In Consumer Reports tests of around 250 cars in 2017, the Spark was rated either #6 or #7 in their accident avoidance (handling) tests.  It matches the Corvette and the new Miata in this regard.  It also has braking scores in the top 20% or so all cars tested. 3.  Traction control can be completely shut off if you wish. 4. All the (0-60) acceleration tests you see are with the CVT trans which has a notable “bog” off the line.  The 5 speed manual is at least a second quicker.  5. I can reach 50 mpg on the highway occasionally, and rarely if ever get below 40 mpg.  My overall average (5 speed manual) is around 42mpg in mixed driving. Hybrid mileage without the hassles and complexity.  Port injection - no D.I.

First of all, this car is small.  Like really small.  If you have children I would not suggest this car to you.  I am only 5'4 and so my seat is pushed up farther than the average person.  There is absolutely no leg room in the back of my car even considering the fact that I'm short and don't need a lot of space in the front.  If you are regularly wanting someone besides a very small child to sit in the back seat, they are going to be uncomfortable or just not fit at all.  This car works for me because I am the only person who is ever in my car.  I very rarely have any passengers, and when I do there is only one so they ride in the front passenger seat.  It is a no-frills car in some way, because there isn't power locks or windows.  I rarely ever put my windows down in previous cars so this does not bother me, it could be bothersome to you.  The technology with the AppleCar Play is wonderful and I will not have another car without it.  I have taken this little car up to 7 hours away (one way) and being able to listen to my podcasts and bring them up through my cars navigation screen is awesome and worthwhile to me.  The car seating is comfortable and I have never felt achey or like I needed to stretch more than usual after long drives.  This could be because I am on the thinner side and short (see previous comments about space issues).  The handling of the car is fine.  It doesn't have stellar shock absorption but thankfully where I drive the most the roads aren't in too bad of shape so I'm not being jostled like I would be on a dirt road or similar situations.   I can go quite a while without having my oil changed which is a bonus, and nothing has needed attention since me buying the car brand new.  I live in the midwest where we get a decent amount of snow and my car goes great in the snow.  The traction control kicks in and does it's job whenever I have happened to hit a slick spot.  Many people are shocked when I make it into work knowing what I drive, but this car has been very good to me in the snow.  Overall, I like the car but it's not a long term car for me.  It is just way too small for when I decide to have children.  Also if I was frequently giving other people rides or needing to haul things then it would not work for that either.  For now, it does what it needs to do and I am happy for that.

I've had this car for about 7 months and I'm already looking to upgrade to a 2013 Kia. I bought my Spark new and I requested a standard key fob remote and I then found that it's not available for the Spark, but there is an Onstar app that does the job. I found out very, very quickly that this was impossible to use - the app was unresponsive and full of glitches, not to mention, they only ""door"" the app unlocked was the trunk! Another complaint I have is the acceleration. It's about a 0-60mph in about 10.5 seconds, making it very difficult not to jolt forward in the Spark when transitioning to a highway from city. Aside from these big complaints, this car is VERY noisy. You can hear more of the ground and wind outside than the stereo system. The stereo system in the LS is very muffled and grainy...if you are someone who relies on music, it becomes very difficult to enjoy any of it with the quality of the speakers. This is a car without Bluetooth connectivity, phone connectivity for calls, or a USB port. Additionally, there is no center counsel for storage. You're left to use the small side pockets on either side of the front seats and an extremely small ""pocket"" in the back with only one pocket on the back of the passenger seat. I feel it is important to mention that when it is a windy day, the Spark will blow and shift slightly into other lanes. This car is very difficult to control in windy conditions.

Great support in the seats.  Smooth but not soft.  Solid and stable at high speed (I've hit 102 with it, running lights and siren).  Corners well for a vehicle of this size.  Interior has a nice quality feel to it.  I love the USB ports!  Plenty of cargo room for my purpose (after we pitched the 3rd row seat that it wasn't supposed to come with, according to purchasing spec).  The new headlamps are awesome, project well! CONs:  For my purpose, the acceleration sucks!  There is a huge delay in response from the gas peddle to wheels turning.  At times, it is as if the truck is trying to figure out which gear to hit.  By comparison, my personal vehicle is a 2500 Ram with the 6.4L Hemi, and also has a 6-speed transmission.  There is no hesitation on my Ram when I punch the peddle.  Chevy needs to work on this point.  Another pet peeve is the windshield wiper controls.  The outboard control operates the rear wiper blade / washer.  The center control on the stick operates the front wipers / washers.  That is completely backwards and anti-intuitive.  The front wipers being what we use the most - why would that control not be the most immediately accessible in the outboard position on the turn stick?  My 2009 suburban had the same stupid stick.  I was hoping Chevy had changed that by now.  My only other complaint is the low ground clearance.  For a 4-wheel drive, it sits low.  So low in fact, those running boards it came with are a trip hazard.  I'm removing and tossing them as well.  I'm now looking into a lift package.  75% of the value of 4WD is ground clearance.

Kudos to Chevrolet. Took delivery on Feb 13, 2018, and with a vengeance Bolt met the winter of north central Minnesota, including driving in temperatures as low as -14F and heavy snow, Performance was excellent. Now 3800 miles later and finally with the arrival of Spring, the Bolt retains its excellence. We live in a rural area and local driving involves round trips to towns and small cities within a 150 mile range. The major reason we picked the Bolt was that we believed, hoped for, the Bolt would meet 100% of our local driving requirements, even in winter. That means at least 150 mile range in very cold, snowy weather, with comfortable security range remaining - the Bolt met this goal. And finally in April with temperature warm-up and disappearance of snow, combined with reasonable driving habits, the Bolt already has provided a range well beyond its rated 238 miles, reaching close to 300 miles. The biggest learning curve was locating and using the various push buttons and controls, headlights, radio, heating/AC fan system, etc. We have been Toyota owners since the early 1980's, and many of the controls are in different places. But, even at my mature age of 71, I have mastered the controls, and I now have found them to be nearly intuitive. One hangup is the cruise control. Nearly every time I engage it initially or reengage, I have to look to find the button. I doubt I will ever find this control to be intuitive to the point of not having to take my eyes off the road. As for driving, acceleration from a stop is better than great, acceleration to pass at highway speed is great. This car really goes. The suspension provides a comfortable ride with very little sway on curves, the seats are comfortable, visibility is very good, the rear view camera screen is really good, the blind space alerts on the outside mirrors are very welcome and safety important, the headlights are the best I've ever had on a car, and all-in-all, I have no complaints about the Bolt. I love to drive this car, no gas or oil change expense, and the only maintenance so far is adding some air to the tires to keep them at 40 psi and filling the washer tank. Although the tires are self-sealing, I did get a lug wrench and jack, with a donut tire I already had, to change a flat, just in case. I bought through the dealer, at a price to match competition, a Level 2 - 240V/32A charger to charge the Bolt at home, and set the charger to complete the charge by 4:00 am so that the Bolt is always ready for an early start day. I have used public DC fast chargers three times just to make sure I know how to use them, in the event the Bolt will take us on a longer journey. In a couple of words, yes, I would buy a Bolt again, unless the next Chevy EV, perhaps a Jolt, has a much longer range with towing capacity.",5.0,Chevrolet,Bolt EV,2017,electric,200.0,0,DIRECT_DRIVE,FWD,4,Compact,Hatchback,110,128,1385,40905,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV 4dr Hatchback FWD (0cyl)

Nevertheless, it is not a fancy car. The seat padding is a bit thin, and depending on your build the seats are a little narrow. All of this is to keep the weight down. That said, it goes like stink and is a blast to drive around. I’ve especially enjoyed the “one pedal driving“ feature, which allows you to reclaim energy when you take your foot off the “gas” pedal.  It’s quite spacious inside, and storage behind the rear seats is pretty generous even before you fold the seats down. The greenhouse is a enormous and visibility is excellent. The upside of the large batteries  is the terrific range. The downside of large batteries is the amount of time it takes to charge them. You have to have a 220 V charger, it comes with a standard 115 V charger, but it will take about a day and a half to charge from empty.  With the 220 V charger, you can plug it in at night and be ready to go in the morning with a full “tank“. As a commuter car, we are charging the car about once a week. Obviously electricity cost money, but it’s definitely less than gas. The car is great around town, and the range gives you plenty of confidence.

My main purpose in buying this was for environmental purposes.  I feel great every time I drive this.  We've got solar panels as well, so we're driving on sunshine.  The car has allowed us to reach our goal of no fuel being used, but has also provided some other perks.  For a small efficient car, it has remarkably good pickup.  It has great acceleration which makes it fun to drive.  It also handles very well.  It also handles pretty well with fairly tight steering.  I've previously owned a Porsche Boxter...and this is no Boxter for sure.  But we recently owned a CR-V and a Prius, and this car definitely has more acceleration and better steering than either of these.  The range is very good so far.  My wife drives 100 miles round trip and it's all freeway.  At 75 mph, this is taking up an estimated 55% of the battery per trip.

I was not impressed that I was looking at spending $24,000 for AWD vehicles that had 40,000 miles on.  Then Chevrolet came out with the 16% off and the new Trax were a  great price.  I test drove the Trax LT AWD and it was basically my Cruz on steroids.  I LOVED it.  Felt comfortable driving it right away.  Low road noise, great handling and pick up on the interstate, lots of head room, just fun to drive.  A couple down sides, I am not a fan of the touch screen, there is no volume knob.. only arrows so it takes longer to increase or decrease the volume, there isn't any voice command for the blue tooth phone connection, you have to search your address book on the screen which takes your eyes off the road.  The back seat is smaller but if the front seats are up a little it is still comfortable to sit in. It probably wouldn't work great with 2 car seats however.  The interior is a little cheaper looking but for the price it is definatley worth it.  I didn't expect the smaller 4 cylinder engine to handle the bigger vehicle but it actually runs great. Very easy to get in and out of and great visabiity since you sit so much higher.  It seems so much bigger when you are in it than it looks on the outside.  Don't be fooled, give it a try.

The seat belts are down right painful for adults butts.  Behind the driver seat you cannot move where the belt buckles in.  There is zero give.

But as I progressed from 2-seaters to mid-size sports sedans to full-size sports sedans over the years, manual transmissions became harder to find. In 2016, there was only one choice for a full-size sports sedan capable of the name that offered a manual transmission and that happened to be the Chevrolet SS. However, the Chevrolet SS is an overkill for me in terms of acceleration and top speed capabilities for which I have never found nor do I anticipate a situation to use such capabilities, but it's nice to know they are there. I do occasionally enjoy accelerating in traffic a ""little"" faster  than most fellow motorist can, and find cornering at speed on twisty roads very confidence inspiring and exhilarating. I've had my 2016 SS for just over two years and 20,000 very enjoyable miles and have had no mechanical problems. Unfortunately, the Chevrolet SS was made for only four years from 2014-2017 and is now discontinued. I highly recommend the Chevrolet SS to those who have needs similar to mine, but now you have to buy a used one. And beware that this is a full-size performance sports sedan on the order of a BMW M5 or Porsche Panamera for half the cost.

The exhaust note in Sport, Performance or Track mode makes me smile every time I start the car and step on the gas. It's also nice to flip to touring to quiet it down a little and smooth out the bumps when cruising on the interstate. Highs include: handling; accelleration; engine/exhaust rumble; exclusivity of having one of only an estimated 10,000 Chevy SS's imported to the US for model years 2014-17 as the 2017's are the last ones being made; and the amazing amount of tech that comes standard. Lows include: no Homelink(!!) so you are stuck with a clunky garage door opener remote; the 6-speed automatic is slow to downshift, sometimes clunks into gear, and overall not very responsive to the 415 hp and 415 lb/ft of torque begging to come out and play; and the brakes started squealing well before needing to be replaced. Overall, finding this car with a 20% GM discount tag makes it the best performance sedan for the money, and one of the few rear wheel drive, naturally aspirated V8's left. The fuel economy is terrible, but people willing to buy this car aren't looking for a Prius so I don't consider it to be a negative.*Update: 6 months later, my review hasn't changed. I put 245/45R18 Michelin X-Ice Xi3 winter tires mounted on all black wheels that looked great and so I could actually drive it during the winter. Tires did great, and I enjoyed having RWD in the snow. It's a lot of fun steering with your throttle. To be clear, this is not an AWD crossover or SUV. It has low ground clearance, RWD, and lots of power. Not the best combination for driving in deep snow.

We did some research and test driving, and she concluded that the Tahoe was the one.   She loved the look, and like the amenities.  The problems started on the test drive, the radio kept freezing up and acting weird.   The dealer was made aware of the issue and we were told we needed to use a factory iphone cable and the problem should be resolved.   We swapped our iphone cable for a brand new factory cable, and for the next day the problem went away.   We purchased the truck the following day.  After the purchase on the drive home, the problem returned.  We called the dealer, and they said, well it needs a software update, it's a known issue.   So in to the dealership to a software update.   Software flashed, tested, they say you are good to go.   A few days later, the problem returns, we contact the dealer, now the story changed.   They knew almost instantly it was a human interface controller board and the part was back ordered from Chevrolet for an unknown amount of time.  They kept the vehicle for the week to fix a few other issues and then we received it back knowing the problem was there, but the part was ordered, and the regional chevrolet rep was in the mix to try and expedite this service request.  At this point we are fairly upset with the whole situation.   Brand new car, and not once has it been right.  Over the next 2 months, roughly 10 electrical gremlins have reared their ugly head in this truck.  Here are a few: headlights randomly switch to high beams, pedals won't adjust, front and rear parking sensors randomly think we are going to hit something even when nothing is around, front camera errors constantly, hvac control back lighting failures, memory seats haven't worked since day one, all of which has been communicated to my dealership and to chevrolet directly, we basically were going to wait for this inteface controller part to come in and try to tackle everything at that time, thinking that the part should fix most of the issues.  Then after 2 months of dealing with all these problems, finally a glimpse of hope... I received a call from my dealer that the controller board arrived from chevy.   Hooray for now!!!  The dealer was nice enough to pickup my truck at my work, and drop me off another Tahoe as a loaner until mine was fixed.   I received a call that night, everything was fixed, they will keep it one additional day for testing, then they will drop it off for me at work.   I got scared that next morning when the loaner tahoe had the same radio problem that my tahoe has...  I was assured by my dealer that everything is fixed, and that between the controller and software updates everything is 100%!  On my drive home the parking sensors went crazy on me.   This was 10 miles down the road after being told it's all fixed.   The radio seemed ok at least, so we decided to give it a few more days before it goes back in.  Well the next morning, the radio went crazy again.   We sent video to the dealer showing the problem, and now we are apparently waiting to see what Chevy and the dealer want to do.   So here we are, MSRP of $64k, and the truck has multiple major systems failing, all electrical.  My recommendation is to wait until the bugs are out of this vehicle!!!!!

I've owned so many and beat the heck out of them, especially in my teen years and early 20's, but they never let me down. Even if they blew up, I always got my money's worth and then some. This time I think I came out even.When my Cavalier broke down after over 10 years of faithful service of taking quite a beating, and right at tax time, I figured I needed to upgrade anyway. After all, our second child would be here soon, and we welcomed the extra space. Went and looked at the Impala, drove it and rushed my decision. The radio was locked two weeks into owning it, and wasn't worth the fee to unlock it, so we upgraded it to one that wouldn't lock again. Then so much was going on with having a newborn and a toddler I didn't have time to have things checked out, like why it shifts so hard from second to third gear unless I'm flooring it. A few months after buying it, we found out the head gasket was bad...while stranded on the highway with two cranky children.My mechanic is the best. He reminded me that next time I look at a used vehicle to have him inspect it, and he would have told me to pass on this one. Come to find out, the slight ""airy"" sound was also the intake gasket. Luckily, since you had to dismantle one to get to the other, it was next to nothing extra to do them both versus doing them separately. The transmission problem was also very common, and needs to be rebuilt. He recommended selling it immediately or driving it until it died and then getting something else.That was 4 years ago now. The transmission oddly has not gotten worse, although I've also gotten used to putting a little extra pressure on the accelerator between 2nd & 3rd gears. The car still starts, drives, and stops just like you'd want it to.

These crossovers were built to go directly to a fleet, meaning they were sold to companies for rental, employees cars and the like. In my search, I found these Captivas were priced anywhere from $2,000 - $4,000 under other similar vehicles in my area. My goal was to find a safe, later model used vehicle that could hold my medical equipment and have easy in and out access for me. I wanted a 4wd to accommodate the winter weather.

I'm a fit 5'10"" and the seats are very comfortable and adjusted perfectly to my liking.  The interior was nicely appointed and not cheap looking.

The Jeep was my second Jeep and my last! Chrysler's dealer network is just not as accomodating, well-training, and educated as Chevy's. My conclusion... ""See ya later Jeep!"".The Equinox is superb and I can honestly say it has the best legroom in its class, period!The interior is ergonomically sound with great technology, comfort and fit/finish.Let me criticize a lot of reviewers out there. Some are customers and others are Journalists...The complaints about the 2.4 are ludicrous. If you have ever driven a 4 cylinder engine and know what to expect/not expect from one, you'll be fine with the performance of this vehicle. The 2.4 and 6 speed combo feels just as good as my 2.4 and 9 speed in the Cherokee. Trust me, you can pass people on the highway and you DONT need to floor it to do so. It has plenty of pep and way better gas mileage than the V6. Unless your towing something, just save yourself the money and get the 4. Don't listen to all these reviewers that want an SUV but also want their SUV to accelerate like a lamborghini. The Equinox 2.4 is just fine!!!!Also, if anyone is wondering I test drove the following before ridding myself of a problematic Jeep:- Rav4- Escape- Edge- Murano- Rogue- Tuscon- Santa Fe- Sportage- Forester- CX9- EquinoxGoing back to the legroom. The most important aspect of us choosing the Equinox, for anyone in a similar situation, was legroom. I am six ft. with long legs and am not comfortable in many small SUVs. We had it narrowed down to the Rogue, which we took for an overnight, and the Equinox.The Equinox had the best legroom in its class by far! I can scoot up to the wheel or have my legs fully extended (with boots on). Also BTW. My dad has a 2012 Equinox, My Mom had a 2010 and just bought a 2015 last years as well. Both have no problems with theirs.Highly satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend to anyone!",5.0,Chevrolet,Equinox,2016,gasoline,182.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,SUV,32,22,1385,22600,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Chevrolet Equinox 4dr SUV FWD (4cyl)

Tow truck came to take me to tire shop. The driver said those inflators never work. At the tire shop I was toldthat they could not repair the tire because the sealer was pumped into it. So the cost of a new tire was very close to $200.and two days to get an exact replacement. Then I found out that I had to replace the inflator sealant , another $80 some.and on order.  So a simple flat was going to cost me about $280 something and wait for sealer refill. When if I hadn't used the sealant it might have been repaired.

I always buy a car that is at least 1 or 2 years old, so I don't get hit with the depreciation the last poster was complaining about on new cars. Test drove and researched many pre-owed vehicles (including Lexus LS, Infiniti Q70, Benz S, BMW 7, Audi A8) before deciding on a low mileage pre-owned 300c AWD v6 for my next car. To say I'm impressed after 500 miles would be an understatement. It is truly the best combo of comfort, performance, safety AND value. Those were my priorities, and this car knocks the ball out of the park. I wanted and found a 300c with the SafetyTec2 Package with adaptive cruise. After using this option for a bit, I wonder how I ever survived without it. It makes driving even more of a pleasure in this car. If you are considering pre-owned in those other big European sedans, do your research... right here on Edmunds. Reliability issues and quirky problems abound in those cars. Even if you pay a fortune for an extended warranty, you'll likely be inconvenienced with multiple trips to the dealership for repairs. Side note: I purchased a Chrysler manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper extended warranty to cover me up to 7 years and 75k miles.... for $1300. Try to get a price for that warranty on one of those Euro sedans. You'll be lucky if you only pay 3x as much.

415, on 03/28/16 07:24 AM (PDT),Alex ,2006 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 4A),The practical people mover for the long term," This is my third Chrysler Product. I had a 94 Grand Caravan. Great engine but poor transmission that required rebuild at 90k miles but the car lasted as a whole until 180k miles with routine maintenance and was still drivable when I donated it to charity. I then had a 2001, where they added a transmission cooler and fixed the transmission issues. The 3.3 Liter (and it's cousin the 3.8) are now powerful engines especially if moving a nearly 5,000 lb car, but it's not meant to be fast. Good torque and the O.H.V engine design keep things simple, and costs down for repairs. This simpler engine has been around for a very long time, and it's fairly easy to service.  But at 180 HP for such a heavy car, it' s very slow.  I now bought my Mom a 2006 Town and Country,  the upscale version of the Dodge Grand Caravan. I feel that in the used car marketplace, the Town and Country is priced nearly identical to the Dodge Grand Caravan but in initial purchase, they are 10k to 15k more in price for not much more in features. I think that if you are buying it without power sliding doors (less that can break) and without a lot of fancy electronics there is less that can break. The best feature of this car is the stow-and-go. You can convert it to a errand car for trips to Home Depot very easily. Another thing not often mentioned is that if you have large dogs, like German Shepherd, or Mastiff, this car's ability to put the rear 60/40 bench seat down and put a dog carrier in the back, is a great way to carry large pets, especially with a lower step in height. Did you ever try to help a 12 year old arthritic dog into a cross over or SUV and help lift such a heavy dog into the tall load floor? For me, my Minivan is my go to car for long trips, or for trips to get paint, or sheetrock. The cost of not renting a truck is very handy.  I think it's a fantastic practical car. It's not particularly fast, but it's a well known design and it's been around forever. I had to replace the water pump at 60k miles. I strongly recommend any new owner change the transmission fluid at 60k miles and again at 120k. You need ATF+4 and make sure Chrysler does it, not some cheapo oil change, as this car is very sensitive to having the correct transmission fluid. Stay on top of your fluid changes for the tranny with these cars.  I have over 100k miles and I mostly had little annoying problems, like door switches and window regulators, but not major break downs. Basic upkeep of new tires, brakes, frequent oil changes. I recommend changing the PCV and EGR valve at the 75,000 mile tuneup, as these parts are not expensive, and can keep car running smoother longer. Overall, it's one of the lowest cost-of-entry in the used car marketplace and cheaper than a Honda or Toyota Sienna while offering all the same value. I like this older body style compared to squared off new version. I also like the fact that they kept the same engine and transmission around for a long time, unlike Kia that went for a well known 3.8 DOHC engine to a 3.4 Liter with variable valve timing in only 10 years. To me, keeping the same basic engine and transmission around for 3 decades helps keep costs down both during purchase and repair time. Overall, not a fancy car, but a very practical car.

First appearance was great! Very specious, decently large trunk, excellent sound quality from the speakers, sharp interior and exterior, minimal road noise. Everything cosmetically was great for a compact car. The first two years I owned the car I did regular maintenance which include a new starter, new tires, breaks, alignment, new belts, air filter, oil changed with synthetic oil every 3000 miles. After the second year everything went down hill.First was the car would shake when I traveled on the freeway and lightly tap the break. It was so dangerous I had to pull over immediately! I was told first by a mechanic that I need new breaks and rotors. I purchased new breaks and rotors which cost me around $300! That wasn't the problem it ended up needing new break calipers which are 150 a piece i needed two.After that I had a coolant leak I needed new clamps for the hose. That was a $40 repair.  The fluids had to be constantly observed especially the coolant. this car had a coolant problem the entire time I owned the car.the breaks needed to be replaced every couple of months! Then the engine failed during winter which cracked the block which lead to me purchasing a used engine with 66k total installation cost 2000. Chrysler dealership wanted to charge me 2000 just for a used engine so that forced me to go else where. The engine failing also lead to the heater coil failing which lead to no heat! With was a 1000 dollar fix OUTSIDE the dealership. The a/c control would not stay on high. The interior no matter how many times I got it detailed would never stay clean the stains just soaked in the fabric. After that my car kept making a loud popping noise when I turned the wheel, then I took it back to the mechanic and it was the complete hub assembly  which cost me over $300 dollars. Then the back door stopped working from the outside . The antenna  flew off. The headliner fell down. Then I thought I could at least get another year out of the car. After 20,000 miles from when I changed the engine, the car over heated blew the radiator hose. Then I had to get it towed to the mechanic where he replaced the hose the part was 55.00 not including labor, he checked the head gasket, compression test, checked for air in the line, replaced both thermostats in the car that cost me over 300 dollars. And it still didn't stop over heating. It would over heat at idle and go back down when I drove it. Also at this point the car had 164k and the linkage kept sticking and transmission was slipping. Plus I had to replace at least 5 sensors on the car  Finally the mechanic told me he recommends selling the car which I did. I hardly got any money for the car I practically gave it away since the car depreciated so much.Just a reminder I did a full carfax report the previous owners also maintained it ever 3000 miles and the car has never been in an accident.Chrysler should be ashamed for putting a car with this many problems on the market",1.0,Chrysler,Sebring,2010,gasoline,173.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,30,21,1013,22115,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2010 Chrysler Sebring 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

Now I have to replace the pulleys for the serpentine belt.  I really like the car, it's fun, great looking, great air, good stereo system and is comfortable to drive anywhere.  Just unusual things go wrong and I didn't purchase an extended warranty due to financial issues at the time. Next time I will and I would buy this car again.

After a month of having it the shifter was stuck in park and had to be towed to dealership. They had the car for a week because the part was not in stock. The engine sounds very whiny and the brakes make alot of grinding sounds. Now with 40k on it the alternator went out on me. I have been calling around and told it would take 3-7 days to get it in and the cost is almost $400. When I called the dealership and asked why this car is having so many problems they said I have never heard of them having any issues. I would never buy a chrysler again.,3.375,Chrysler,Sebring,2010,gasoline,173.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,30,21,1013,22115,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2010 Chrysler Sebring 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

Started having problems 2 days after I took it home. Had problems with the check engine light- had to replace the PCP.  Had problems with the sunroof/spoiler. The car makes noises when you start it and power steering make cluck noises when you turn corners.  Took it back to the dealership for the 8th time but they say these problems were just the way the car was built. Please don't buy this car unless you want a noisy car.  Looks nice from outside but the engine sounds very loud.  I just recently noticed a gaping crack where the bumper meets the rest of the car.  Looks to be pulling away.

427, on 02/24/17 21:31 PM (PST),Anthony ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan S 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Great Value on a Great Car!," Although I have owned my 2016 Chrysler 200S V6 AWD for 2 weeks and have a little under 400 miles on the odometer I can say with certainty that I absolutely love this car. Due to my job and being in the North East I needed an AWD vehicle and this Chrysler more than fits the bill. It has a nice and aggressive exterior design and the interior is absolutely fantastic.  The front seats are comfortable and supportive while the controls are within easy reach. I purchased mine fully load with every option available. Heated and ventilated leather front seats, heated steering wheel, blind spot detection, navigation, panoramic moon roof, alloy wheels, rear seat vents and auto start. I traded my Honda Accord Sport for my 2016 Chrysler 200S and have been smiling ear to ear since. Previous to the Honda Accord Sport I owned a Mitsubishi Lance Ralliart that had a turbo charged 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine yet my Chrysler 200S performs almost as well. Bare in mind that the Ralliart was a sports car and the Chrysler is a family sedan yet the 295 horsepower V6 has plenty of power when needed and the Sport mode will push you back into your seat if you get hard on the gas. 0-60 in about 5.8 seconds is plenty quick for me especially when my Ralliart went 0-60 in 5.5 seconds. Its basically an AWD family sedan muscle car that has a sweet sounding exhaust.   I will say that this car is by no means perfect. The 9 speed automatic transmission can be a bit clunky at times, the stock tires are terrible and rear seat headroom is an issue if you have passengers over 6 feet tall riding in the back. I'm not in love with the braking either as the car is heavy but it my opinion the braking should be more responsive. Perhaps I just need to get used to it. However, when you take over $10,000 in incentives into consideration and can buy a car like this for under $30K it's an absolute no brainer. 3 years 36,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty and 5 years 60,000 miles on the powertrain. If you're like me and are looking for an AWD vehicle that has sharp looks, plenty of cargo room, have little ones and want a vehicle that can get you from 0-60 in less than 6 seconds look no further than the Chrysler 200S AWD V6. It's being discontinued so get one while you can before it's too late.",5.0,Chrysler,200,2016,flex-fuel,184.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,36,23,1013,21995,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Chrysler 200 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

It is a lemon! I would not buy one if I were you! The Alternator alone was $600.00 with parts and labor. They had to build an entire new Ignition system that was not covered under any warranty so out of pocket another $1000.00!!!! Then the fuel injection stopped firing properly so another out of pocket $700.00! And now I turn the key this morning and nothing ! Battery is good !

She knows nothing about cars, so as long as it works, she won't care. So far, I haven't had any major issues with my car and I'm at 80K miles, but I still fear for my life. There was a recall on seatbelts and airbags. As long as you don't suck at driving though, you can survive. It gets great gas mileage! I started working in town and didn't have to commute, so I'm still at a full tank after filling up last week. But that's probably the only good thing about this car. This car has a 2.4 inline-4 engine, and the 3.6 V6 has 110 more horsepower but same mpg. This car is gutless. You press on the gas pedal and you almost hear the engine ask you to repeat yourself because it didn't hear you and then you find out your engine is a turtle crawling backwards in January. The 4 speed transmission is like an older gentleman, it's slow to decide on what it wants to do, even though you told it what to do a thousand times. I tried buying aftermarket parts to modify it's performance and literally the only thing anybody makes for it is a cold air intake. So you really won't get far with that idea. The exhaust is fairly loud, but only from inside the cab if that makes any sense. The radio at least works, it has a 6 disc CD player because we all need that, but at least it had an auxiliary port, but no Bluetooth or usb. The seats are pretty comfortable, but for about 2 hours. After that, your butt starts getting numb. After all the immediately important stuff, then you think about what to do when something needs repairs. Engine parts aren't too hard to find as long as it's a sensor. Anything else is special order from dealer or it doesn't exist. Changing out a simple battery requires the removal of the front left wheel and fender. Buying a new engine or transmission if necessary, is almost as much as the car is worth. That actually doesn't say much... Wheels are common though, brakes are easy to replace, oil changes are a breeze, but I got my hand stuck trying to change my headlights because I didn't like the idea of removing the bumper to get to it. Overall, this is one of those cars you only should drive as a rental or a lease when it had 30k miles on it. But after 100k, well I don't think I've ever seen one yet that isn't for sale.",2.0,Dodge,Avenger,2012,gasoline,173.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,31,20,1851,21495,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2012 Dodge Avenger 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

VERY impressed.   So I decided to lease a jazz blue SXT, and had the dealer add a rear spoiler with posts, and it looks RETRO AS HELL!!  I really like it!!  Only negative is now that I'm older since the car rides very low to the ground, it takes a pretty good effort for me to get out of the car.

My ride was a 2011 Camry which was all about utility:  relatively comfortable, excellent fuel economy, and stellar reliability, BUT...there was just no excitement whatsoever to that car.  I wanted some pizzazz.  A ride to put the thrill back into driving again.  I finally narrowed it down to the Challenger, going for the base SXT, which comes standard with everything I wanted.  Only extra on the car is one year sat radio, and I had the side and rear windows tinted.  Incredible value in this base car which I got into brand new for 22 and change with 0% APR.  This coupe has it all:  incredible retro styling, comfy well appointed interior, quiet smooth big car ride, gobs of power, a huge trunk, and a very usable rear seat.  I've had it for 2 months and 3400 miles now, nearly all of those miles hwy and I gotta tell you...this is one sweet ride that puts a grin on my face every time I get behind the wheel.  I find myself out in the garage all the time just admiring how it looks.  And I get compliments on it wherever I go.  Nobody ever had anything to say about my ho-hum Camry.  Fit and finish is impeccable, and everywhere I look there's some little extra that Dodge added to make this one special car, like the Challenger silhouette racing across the bottom of the windshield, or the carpeting on the back of the seat belt latches.  There's only a couple of things not offered that I'd like to see:  auto up windows and attachments for a cargo net in the trunk.Update 1/4/18:  Have a bit over 20,000 miles on the Challenger now.

Not everyone can afford $40+k for a car, so I decided to go for the base model SXT in white, with Blacktop package, 20"" wheels, black aluminum rims, 8.4"" Uconnect with Nav, and premium speakers. First off for being the base model even with just a V6, it's awesome. The entire care is white and black which together go beautifully. But the fact that the car is white, rims, spoiler, stripes and fuel door are black, just makes it look amazing!!! Then you have the inside with the huge 8.4"" screen, the beautiful instrument cluster, awesome sound system, I mean you can't go wrong. Yeah it is just the base model with extra ad ons, but it suits me just fine!! I'm tired of reading all the reviews and how people are slamming the base model saying it doesn't offer much. BS!!!! For someone wanting a muscle car, but who is on a budget like myself, it's an awesome model to get, especially if you opt to get some of the ad ons like I did, which kept it at around $31k. The V6 engine at 305hp is nothing to be disappointed at, and realistically where are you gonna use more horsepower than that??? 305 gets the job done for me!!! I wish there was a way I could post pictures of my baby!!! She definitely gets a great deal of looks and compliments, and again, is only the base SXT model which I am extremely happy with!!!",5.0,Dodge,Challenger,2016,gasoline,305.0,6,AUTOMATIC,RWD,2,Large,Coupe,30,19,1851,29995,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,2016 Dodge Challenger 2dr Coupe RWD (6cyl)

EVER.," If you're thinking about buying this car, read this first: RUN FOR THE HILLS AND NEVER COME BACK!!! This is the absolute worst car I've ever owned or even been in. Let's start from the top... It's extremely uncomfortable to be in for long periods of time. It's very loud to ride in - you can hear all the road noises and it almost sounds like the tires are bare even if they are brand new. The seat material is the WORST! They stain even from water, and they're just ugly colors. The whole interior design of this car is hideous, and really?? A cooler in the glove box?? How fat do we need to be, America, that you need a cooler for your canned sodas in your car? This car started stalling while driving or sitting at stoplights about a month into owning it. It also sputters if I filled the gas tank all the way up. I had to replace the engine mount TWICE - once before 100,000, and once at 150,000. I had to replace the cv joints after owning it for a year. If you go over a tiny speed bump it feels like you're driving a clown car going over really high railroad tracks. It's the most nauseating car to drive in or sit in. It has a hard time accelerating which is always fun going on the freeway. I'm not hard on my cars and had a Toyota Corolla and a Volvo that hit 200,000 and 350,000 miles, respectively. I bought this car because my Volvo went out and I needed something cheap immediately. Wow, what a mistake. Of course, I read the horrible reviews of this car after I bought it. There are people who think this car should have been recalled and I'm on that same boat. This is a wretched automobile that should have never been made. I bought a brand new Honda Civic and I'm never, ever going to buy an American car again.

My parents originally owned the car and had to pour almost $3000 in the last 3 years into this poor thing. We've replaced a good 3 or 4 batteries, a piston malfunctioned and cracked the cam shaft (that was 1500 right there), electronic throttle control went out (and its also starting to go out AGAIN), and a few other small things here and there. Now at the age of 18 I purchased the car from them so I could have it for college. Now i'm terrified to drive it. I've had a few times where the car won't even start because the electronic throttle control is acting up again, and when its not doing that the car really struggles to turn on sometimes. Acceleration is not too great either. I understand that it's not a huge truck and it doesn't have a huge engine, but its still pretty wimpy. Now the car is starting to make creaking sounds ALL the time, and with it being this car i'm not too surprised it's happening.

The seats are comfortable but a tight fit with just enough leg room for an average size person.  If you are really tall or maybe a little rotund, you are out of luck if you want to drive this car!  After driving this little convertible sports roadster over 2,000 miles, I have had a lot of smiles on my face but also a couple of frowns.  My vehicle came equipped with high performance three season tires which do perform very well when the temperature is above 40 deg. F, but if you live where winter temperatures dip below 40, you have to switch out these tires for all-season or snow tires... an extra expense.  Otherwise, it must be garaged during very cold wintry days.  I replaced the factory equipped tires with high performance all-season tires and they have performed very well for me even in the cold winter months.   Also, the instrument panel's outdoor temperature display at any outside temperatures is pretty much a joke.

However, the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product, which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair, the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week, my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort,  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block, placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet,  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute, even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares, really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.

This is my second FIAT, trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position, sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive, even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows, the high seating position, and spotter mirrors on both sides, all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements, but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer, but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured, so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20,000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance, the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50,000 mile warranty, too.  On one hand, it is a shame this car doesn't sell better, but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving, so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!

It's really an amazing car when considering it's price.  For what I paid I got an IRS, big engine that I can put a supercharger on and crank it up to 800hp at the wheels (when the warranty runs out), excellent looks all around, and a car that has over 50 years of history/experience behind it!  Comparing it's specs to any other car in the same price range consistently showed it to be the far superior choice which is ultimately why I chose it.  Only complaint I have are the summer only Pirelli's Ford went with for the performance package.  Pure garbage!  They don't offer any superior performance even on hot dry pavement over Pilots and other popular replacements.  Plus they wear out VERY quickly!

A drunk driver going 120 mph rear ended an SUV, SUV bounced off the railing, crossed two lanes and struck my mustang on the drivers side.  My car went sideways 300 feet down the highway and off an embankment.  The car was totaled but I walked away with bruising, whiplash and working up back issues.  I had no hesitation in buying another mustang as I know it lives up to the safety ratings as well as its roll rating (my car did not which shocked the state police and fire crew).  I bought a stripped down coupe as I did not want all the electronics.  I live in area that gets snow.  I had no real issue with the rear wheel once I figured out where to put the weight.  I bought a manual and I am loving it.  I feel it has more acceleration then 2012 V6 mustang.  The interior is a bit smaller, seems designed for two people and a child in the back seat.

The car is equipped with a six speed automatic. It is silver and  is beautiful to look at and well engineered by Ford. I love the smoothness and power of the V6.  The car is a pleasure to drive around town or on the highway. It feels solid and sounds great with a slight rumble, especially on start up. I think Ford has made a huge mistake in phasing out the V6 in the Mustang for 2018. If anything, Ford should tweak the engine a bit more to keep up with the Camaro V6. I chose the Mustang over the Camaro for its looks , styling and better visibility and pricing. I chose the ingot silver and have had lots of compliments on the car at gas stations and parking lots, etc. I am thrilled with every aspect of this car except for the lack of leg room in the back seat and the lack of a spare tire. Ford seems to think an air pump in the trunk will get you home rather than providing a donut spare tire. I ordered a spare tire on line which is happily in my trunk in the event of a flat.  Ford needs to reevaluate sending its customers out on the road without the proper equipment to drive home safely. Great car, great pricing, great engineering.

I would have easily given my 2011 5-stars... I struggle to give the 2017 more than 3 but it does have great engine power, looks amazing, and will hopefully be as reliable in the end as my 2011.

Doing 80 on the freeway in a straight line, the car feels planted to the pavement, but if you hit any sort of uneven surface while turning above 30 mph, the experience is unsettling for both the car and driver.  If the pavement is anything but bone dry, the Stang needs skill and a steady hand.  With the V8 and the suspension you get, the GT is certainly worth the extra few K.

I bought my 2015 Mustang used in 2016 with approximately 13000 miles. Loved the car at first. Impressive for a Ford. I live in Florida and it is warm year round in most parts of the State. However, I barely use the AC, I prefer the windows down unless it is scorching heat and humidity. Five months into ownership at approximately 20000 miles the AC stopped working and I took it to a Ford dealer. It was covered under the 3yr/36000 BTB warranty. The problem was the Evaporator. The repair took several days as it required the techs to remove the entire dashboard to remove and replace the Evaporator. I thought it was poor location design if the part would fail with such low mileage or time. However, I also thought that this was an isolated issue and at 20000 miles it was now fixed. Fast forward 15 months and 20000 additional miles, go figure the AC stopped working again. The 12 month 12000 mile warranty on parts and labor is now expired and the 3yr/36000 is no longer applicable. I took the car to another Ford stealership, and the problem was diagnosed as the Evaporator again. The cost to repair it is $2400, $600 parts, remaining labor. Outrageous, the same part twice within 40000 miles. This would not be such an issue if the part was easily accessible and low cost. I called Ford Corporate, they assigned a case number and communicated with the stealership. End result = end user must pay for Ford's defective part. DO NOT BUY A 2015-17 FORD MUSTANG. Do your research, not an isolated incident. Unless you plan on paying $2400 every 20000 miles or 15 months for a reoccurring problem that Ford knows about. I did not have the repairs done at the stealership. They emailed me for feedback, albeit automated, so here it is: This was my first and last Ford. They have lived up to their reputation.

The Evo was a rocket on wheels, but the Mustang is a true GT car (Grand Tourer/Gran Tourismo). I'd subjectively rate this car as about 4.7, but there's no decimal in the star rating.  I had test driven a 2010 GT, and HATED it.  The engine was great, but the rest of the car was junk.  It FELT cheap (brand new, rattled and squeaked, and only had about 15 miles on the odo).  It did NOT like corners.  At all.  When the back end tries to beat the front around a corner, that's not a good thing.  The interior was horrible, CHEAP plastic EVERYWHERE.  That car had one trick ... go fast in a straight line, hoping the thing didn't vibrate apart along the way.  The 2015 is several orders of magnitude better than the 2010, hands down!!  Particulars:  The Mustang GT Coupe with a 6 spd manual has plenty of get up and go.  Is it the fastest car out there?  No.  But, with 435 bhp on tap, it WILL move.  It accelerated faster off the line than the Evo.  The track functions are fun to play with in an empty parking lot, or a deserted mountain road.  The brakes on this car are incredible!  Gotta be really careful, as they grab FAST and HARD.  There is pretty much no fade through use.  So far, as for road-holding, you have to work to make it lose traction.  Seriously.  Taking some of the curves on the highways in Phoenix at 80+ mph is almost, dare I say it, yawn-inducing!  No fuss, no muss, no worries at all.  Steering is precise, and there is decent feel in the wheel.  It's not like the old manual steering days, but you can still tell what's going on up front.  The front seats are REALLY comfortable!  I did a 16 hour road trip, only stopping for gas, and I didn't end up with any fatigue or discomfort while driving.  The bolsters are good at keeping you where you need to be without being painfully intrusive like Recaro's can be.  Rear seats ... good for small people.  I mean SMALL.  Three feet or less.  At 6' 4"", no ""car"" is easy to get into or out of.  Trucks, yes.  Cars?  No.  However, for average height people, entry/exit is a breeze.  Ford did a really good job with the noise dampening.  The stock exhaust has a pleasant, albeit quiet, growl at highway speeds.  However, tire noise on worn tires can be a bit intrusive, but not obnoxiously so.  Ride comfort ... see above about the 16 hour road trip.  There are sufficient cubbies to lose stuff in.  The instrumentation is clear and easy to read most of the time.  There are occasions when the auto setting for lighting is less than ideal, like exiting a tunnel.  The dash is pretty dark at that point and you may not be able to read the instruments until the lights kick back off.  The interior is well laid-out and the controls are easily within reach.  Commonly used controls are in good spots.  The materials used are generally MUCH better than in previous generation Mustangs, but don't expect a Rolls Royce or Bentley.  The radio is pretty good.  I don't have navigation, but getting my phone hooked up to Sync was pretty easy.  There are two USB ports for connecting/charging devices, or you could stream audio via BT.  Climate controls are easily reached and used, and the heater/A/C both work well.  The only niggling little things that I find annoying are a rattle that has developed behind the center dash stack (FIXED!), and the tendency of the transmission to be a bit balky shifting into 6th.  Otherwise, I think this car really does follow the spirit or intent of a GT (Grand Tourer/Gran Tourismo) vehicle.  It has power, comfort, poise, and style without getting into cartoonish or boy racer realms.  While this car may have been marketed to a younger audience, it should also appeal to folks over 40 who don't have to worry about kids in the back seat.  It can represent on the track as well as devour long miles in comfort.  This is probably THE best Mustang Ford has ever produced!  The early models in the 60s were great, but thanks to 50 years of evolution, these are just better in pretty much every way.  It ain't perfect, but it ain't far from it, either.  EDIT:  Corrected a couple of grammatical issues.  Also, wanted to add that, for the price (mine was just over $34K), you really can't beat it.  The Evo was $47K!  I would seriously recommend you check this car out before going for pricier European options, or even other American options.  I've driven Challengers and was not impressed.  I drove an older Camaro (2011), and like it, but I like my Mustang better.  It's not gonna be for everyone, but it should be tested before being removed from consideration!  UPDATE:  Still loving my Mustang!  It cruises smoothly at highway speeds, as any true GT car should.  The mileage is a function of throttle position - the mileage below shows combined city/highway driving, the highway cruising at 75-80 (and that's just keeping up with traffic!).

How the folks at Ford can give us this much power at $40k, I don’t know.While its appeal should be global, the car still attracts traditional muscle car enthusiasts. Random guys on motorbikes and other sporty vehicles have shadowed me lately and some drove alongside the Mustang to check it out, to then accelerate and pass with a thumbs-up. By far the most impressive part is the handling, my Recaro seats hold me tightly when cornering, and the Pirellis push the dangers beyond my own driver limits. Acceleration is smooth and seems to redline way too early, a beautiful transmission is a pleasure to shift, the responsive steering has three settings from comfort to normal to sports mode, and the sound of the 8cyl is aggressive enough to make me smile every time I push the start button.Only thing I regret is getting the performance package.

Needless to say, I had so many quality issues that I did not feel comfortable owning the car past the warranty expiration and sold it a week after the warranty expired. It had countless issues, and overall I have spent at least 6 months of my total ownership driving the car with an issue, in the shop, or attempting to get the dealership to fix the issue multiple times. I have owned Fords my whole life and everyone in my family has only owned Ford products, and this is by far the worst vehicle Ford makes. A summary of the issues I had are: (1) The first week of ownership, the dashboard did not line up with trim pieces, and couldn't be fixed. When peering at the top of the dashboard, you could see the a/c vent hoses through the gaps. The carpet covering the trunk was loose and flapped around. The first time I laid the rear seats down, the entire seat cover ripped and ruined the cushion, requiring a full replacement of the rear seats. (2) The driver's side tweeter speaker was replaced twice and was failing again when I sold it. (3) The passenger seat squeaked in turns and required full replacement. (4) Volume knob on the infotainment system stopped working and constantly turned down the volume. (5) Trim pieces under the dashboard fell out. (6) The trim on the outside passenger window came loose and ruined the laminate that makes the window trim matte finish. Took 3 months and 4 trips to the dealer to properly fix. (7) The driver's seat was discolored and was beginning to rip. Luckily, I avoided the major transmission issues that plague the PowerShift transmission, and I never had any mechanical issues, but interior quality was so bad, I was afraid to continue owning the car! MPG and low fuel costs were a high point, on road trips I managed almost 50MPG! The Bluetooth was also extremely quick to connect and always worked the way it should. Because of this car, I don't think I could ever own a Ford again, which is just so unfortunate for someone who loved the brand and their products.",2.0,Ford,Fiesta,2015,gasoline,120.0,4,MANUAL,FWD,4,Compact,Sedan,36,28,5657,18405,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2015 Ford Fiesta 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

The car may seem small but feels big behind the wheel. I run full synthetic oil rather then the blend that Ford was using. Runs much better on synthetic, I use a K&N Oil Filter as well seem to working just fine no problems there. Also run a K&N Air Filter, this added a little more power. Transmission is really great, only had to replace the Transmission Control Module around 6,000 miles, but warranty covered it in full. Other then that have not had any problems.

After extensive research and test driving 32 different cars over the span of a little over a year, I chose the Fiesta ST.  This car really hits the sweet spot of efficiency, performance, and practicality.  If I want to drive it hard this car is more than willing to play.  If I want to be efficient, this car has no problem taking it easy.  I particularly like the 6sp manual transmission feel and the VERY responsive brakes.  Although my car is not tuned for greater performance, the aftermarket is booming for this car as well. In mixed driving I get 32.6mpg with 93 octane.  Although I have not had the opportunity to take it on a long road trip I'm very confident that if I use the cruise control and drive it intelligently, I could easily hit closer to 36mpg.  I drove similar competitors from Subaru, VW, & Fiat...the Fiesta ST was the clear hands down winner.  I'm currently at 7K miles and am stoked anytime I get to drive this car anywhere.  Truly outstanding in the hot hatch 4cyl turbo class!  Strong suggestion: try out the Recaro seats before committing to buy the vehicle.  I tried both Recaro & regular ST seats and opted for the regular seats.

The Ford Focus Hatchback SE meets all those expectations. Originally we planned on getting a 2014 Ford Focus, but the 2015 was only about $1k more so we decided to get the newest model. The car itself is very sporty, with black and silver rims as well as paddle shifters on the steering wheel (for those who would like to drive the car in the optional sport/manual mode). The cloth interior is very durable and comfortable. The radio, bluetooth, and climate control are also user friendly for those who may not be used to having more technology in their car. Driving the hatchback is smooth, and especially quiet on the freeway or on bumpier roads. The one thing I found surprising in this car is the sensitivity of the accelerator; you do not have to press down hard on it for the car to accelerate quickly. The only downside to the car is the leg room for the back seats. However, it won't matter as much if you are driving with one or two other people.

The car suddenly losses the ability to accelerate, very unsafe. First time it happened I tried restarting the car but it didn't help. I had ford roadside tow the car to the nearest dealer. I was told by that dealer they see it has a code, the throttle body was the problem. But when they test drove the next day it accelerated fine. Which ment they wouldn't be allowed to fix it by Ford motor company unless it continues to happen. I called the dealer we bought it from. They were very kind and said they would order the new throttle body and to keep driving the car. I was told it would be best for the warranty if it continues to happen. Well today my car broke down 4 times!! After the 3rd power loss I tried to have it towed to the dealer that already had a part on order. However I was told it had to go to the nearest Ford. I was so upset I hung up and decided to try to make it home to have my husband follow me to the dealer we were already working with. I was driving past the nearest ford on my way home. So I stopped and explained the problem and that I felt unsafe driving. I was told they couldn't take the car for repair if another dealer already ordered parts, they also said they were not able to help me get it to the other dealer maybe 20 min away. I was told to drive it on back roads and that it shouldn't keep happening. Well I tried but when it broke down during rush hour for the fourth time only a few miles down the road. I had the car towed to the dealer that had ordered the parts. No new car with 6,000 miles should break down 5 times! No car company should the car must to go to the nearest dealer and when it gets there refuse service. Parts are back ordered for weeks but I won't be driving that car.

First, the out-gassing of the interior materials nearly makes me sick. I can't use the re-circulation on the climate control, I'd rather suck in diesel exhaust. Hopefully that subsides soon. Second, the brakes aren't up to snuff. Light peddle yields no action then the nose dives when brakes are needed in stop and go traffic. Already logged more ""hard"" braking occurrences in a week than in 4 years of previous vehicle. I'm going to try switching to ceramic pads. Third, Cruise Control and Climate Control require eyes off the road to operate and the buttons do not have a distinct feel that one could get used to without looking. Last car could operate all of cruise with thumb and climate was perfect reach on the dash. Fourth gas mileage rating is unfortunately accurate. All previous cars I was able to get better results than advertised, not this time. Overall, it should be a fine car and it was heavily discounted which always is appreciated.

The Escape has fancy chipped keys, of course. I checked both keys before I left the dealership, drove the car home last night, drove it to church this morning, and when I came out of church, the key I had used to drive to church had stopped working. Apparently the excitement of an hour in church was too much for the key, causing it to expire. Luckily, I still had the extra key in my purse - I had intended to take it out and store it in a safe place at the house, but I hadn't gotten around to doing that yet. So I was able to drive home after about five minutes of WTF in the church parking lot. But now I'll have to go back to the dealership tomorrow to have a new key programmed. Gee what a fun way to spend two hours of my life. What's particularly annoying is, the excellent potential for being stranded at some random location by the side of the road. It's just luck that I had the spare key in my purse (instead of stowing it safely at the house, which I had intended to do) and it's just luck that the key died while I was in church at 11 am instead of in a lonely highway pullover at 2 am.This doesn't give me any confidence at all in the car keys or the car. Apparently I'll have to carry a spare on me at all times because of the risk of key failure. In twelve years, none of my Toyota keys ever failed, even though I put them through the washer and dryer several times due to leaving them in my jeans pocket - and one key was still good after I dropped it in the yard while working outdoors and my son found it six months later, after it spent a full winter outside. And of course, now that the key failed so promptly, I'm now wondering what else is likely to go wrong. At this moment, I hate my new Ford Escape, which I have owned for less than 24 hours.

I have had a 2007 Shelby gt500 and a 2007 saleen s281 and while neither could hold a candle to the 2014 they were much easier to drive fast and in a way more fun because you weren't as worried about pushing them. That being said the 14 is an incredible car in every other way, the brakes, handling etc are great, even though this car also has a live rear axle it is way better than the 07 saleen and Shelby that I had. I have the recaro seats in mine and they are very comfortable, big complaint is the ford sync system, it sucks period, navigation hasn't been right yet, hands free phone never works, stereo is weakest in any new car I've ever owned and its the upgraded version with the sub in the trunk, thank god the exhaust sounds so good lol, I realize you don't buy this car for the stereo or navigation but shame on ford for putting this crap in a 70k car. as for driving this car like a pussycat its very tame if you want it to be, the stories about the horrible clutch are bs, the pedal is not too stiff and I have yet to ever stall it, even though its geared so high I can pull into my road at 15mph in 3rd and move fine up a pretty steep hill to my house.

I purchased the 2016 model year since there was minimal changes to the 2017 model.  I wasn't really looking for a diesel, but the more research I did made me realize it was the right choice.   Major factor for me was the reduced pricing (was able to buy for 37K + fees) -would not have bought the diesel if it was over 40k.  At that price would have gone with the Sierra.  Here are the things I really like so far: Parking is so much easier than full size truck, fits in the garage, crew cab has plenty of room for family of 4, fuel mileage, cosmetically pleasing exterior - it actually looks like a smaller version of the Sierra.  The leather interior, infotainment system and back up camera are all nice features.   I love the purr of the duramax and can't wait to tow something or go up in the mountains.

634, on 11/10/15 12:36 PM (PST),Rick ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-2 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very good vehicle - most of the time," We basically picked this vehicle based on cost after our GMC Envoy XL had major problems, but we very happy with the choice after the fact. We wanted an Acadia, but the $10K+ price difference was too much. The Terrain rides great, it's easy to drive, is comfortable and pretty spacious for a ""compact"" SUV.  It has way more room in the back seat than the Envoy did and I know it has better front passenger area than the Envoy. We fit 5 of us (kids 16, 8 & 3) but it's a little tight (my 8 yr old can't us his booster seat with 3 in the back seat).  It's easy and comfortable to drive (even when loaded down) and it's mostly quiet.  There is a lot of tire noise (not sure if it's the car or the tires though) which can get really loud on the highway.  The cargo area is a little small considering this isn't really a small vehicle, but the back seat can be adjusted to make more space (but not by much without sacrificing all the leg room).  We recently took a 2500+ mile trip with all of us.  Even loaded with all 5 of us and all the luggage (including a roof cargo box) the ride and handling were very good.  I was surprised the back end didn't lower much once everything/everyone was loaded up either.  You noticed the weight when driving, but it didn't make it much harder to drive and I quickly got used to it. Even after 12+ hours in the car we didn't feel really stiff or sore and we survived with 3 in the back seat.  This is where I wished we got the 6 cyl motor though.  The 4 cyl is good 90% of the time for us, so it probably is the better overall choice.  It really struggled at higher speeds (70 MP+) with all of us and the luggage; although understandably so considering it was probably about 1000 lbs of people & gear.  We only got about 23 MPG for the trip so I was disappointed in that (I expected about 25 MPG with the cargo box). It downshifts on almost any kind of hill trying to maintain speed.  The constant shifting gets annoying; especially when it kicks down a couple of gears.  It's kind of like 2 different vehicles when it comes to the mileage (even without the cargo box).  If you stay between 60 - 65 MPH it easily gets 28 - 30 MPG.  Once you start going 70 or more it really drops off to low to mid 20's. I guess because the squared off styling.Overall = Likes: styling, comfort (although the seat material with the holes can be a little itchy & collects crumbs/dirt), ride, stereo is very good, gas mileage (most of the time) and safety ratings. Good amount of storage places, cup holders and charging ports.  The center console is quite large which can make it a little hard to find things with too much stuff in it. I think the headlights and fog lights work great; good brightness and distance so you don't have to use high beams all the time.  Dislikes: 4 cyl when the vehicle is loaded up, no rear A/C vents and the front ones are low (glad we got a light colored one), cargo area is a little small. My 8 yr old says the center seat in the back is too hard.  The transmission downshifts a lot because it always tries to get to the highest gear.  It can be difficult to try to accelerate a little bit without it downshifting (and sometimes it goes down 2 gears).Update 5/26/16:Most of what I previously stated still applies to this vehicle.  Overall, I really like this SUV and my wife and I enjoy driving it.  It's comfortable, rides and handles well, and gets good mileage (especially compared to averaging about 15 MPG with our Envoy).  We have over 28K miles in the year we've had it and never had a problem and no rattles, random noises, etc.  A little thing that continues to annoy me: the back wiper design.  It doesn't extend away from the window very far so it makes it difficult to clean the whole wiper blade and where it rests; making it hard to keep the window and blade clean. Admittedly, I have a ""thing"" about clean windows so it's probably just me.  My biggest problem is still the engine. If you have to try to accelerate quickly, it just doesn't like it. It downshifts multiple gears and makes a lot of engine noise, revs way up but very little forward motion with all of that.  Again, for most of the time it's fine, but lane changes or passes have to be planned.  If I had the V6 though I probably wouldn't be happy with the gas mileage.  GMC needs to figure out and engine in between the two that gives more horsepower without killing mileage.  Maybe the turbo 4 (2 liter I think) GM uses in a lot of their other cars or better yet the diesel from the Canyon  would be ideal (probably never happen).  I started driving a 03 Highlander as my daily driver now.  The difference between the ride, handling, noise, etc. is definitely in favor of the Terrain in that comparison.  The V6 in the Highlander makes my highway driving so much easier though and I still get about 22 mpg.",4.0,GMC,Terrain,2015,gasoline,182.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,SUV,32,22,549,24070,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2015 GMC Terrain 4dr SUV FWD (4cyl)

It looks cool too. There were so few of them on the road that we Crosstour drivers would sometimes wave at each other. I guess we felt a certain brotherhood about it. I often drove this car for 11 hours in a day and the seat is marvelous. This was our first AWD car and we'll never go back. Great on snow and ice. We even crossed a creek and climbed out a steep muddy bank with no trouble at all. The one big downside, especially for my wife is the visibility out the back and the blind spots. Had a few close calls changing lanes. A backup camera and blind spot warning technology would solve that.  We usually got 28 mpg on the highway @ 79mph with the AC on. By the summer of 2018 we had 146k miles on it and the only repair ever needed on it was a leaking AC coolant line and a faulty tire pressure sensor. A super reliable car! Just traded it for a 2015 Acura RDX which is nice, but not nearly as cool.

654, on 05/25/17 06:00 AM (PDT),Patrick ,2016 Honda HR-V SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT),Good at being adequate," I purchased a 2016 Honda HR-V LX AWD as my family's secondary vehicle which I occasionally use for work.  I had previously owned a Jeep Renegade that I absolutely loved and my wife had a 2015 Subaru Crosstrek.  (we traded in both our Renegade and a Subaru Crosstrek for a Jeep Grand Cherokee as we wanted something bigger and I had a company car at the time - then I switched jobs and lost the company car, so we needed something ASAP).  My primary reason for getting the HR-V vs. the Renegade or Crosstrek was that for an equally equipped Crosstrek, I was looking at about $25,000, and for an equally equipped Renegade about $27,000.  The HR-V came in at $22,500 sticker price.  I liked the styling of the HR-Vs I had seen on the road, went by the Honda Dealership and got a great deal on a left-over 2016.  I am now about 3,000 miles into owning the vehicle and my experience has been ... adequate.  There is nothing overly exciting about the HR-V.  It isn't a bad looking vehicle, but it isn't an eye catcher.  It just kind of is what it is.  I enjoy the handling of the HR-V, it is great for tight parking lots, around town and city traffic driving. There is a zippy, go-cart feel to the HR-V, reminiscent of driving around my old 1987 Honda Prelude I had in college.  It is also surprisingly solid on the highway and has a solid, upright seating position that feels surprisingly like a real SUV (vs. complaints I always had with my wife's Crosstrek which felt unsecure on the highway and I felt like I was sitting on the floor).  I have never had an issue with acceleration.  I constantly see complaints about acceleration in other people's reviews.  Ok, if you're looking for a sports car, this isn't it.  But one thing I feel everyone overlooks is that if you want better acceleration, there is a ""sport mode"" you can put the HR-V in which gives you just that at the expense of some MPG.  The cargo / storage versatility of the vehicle is its high point as there is a lot of cargo space when the seats are down.  The ""Magic Seats"" are a cool car showroom gimmick but I honestly have never used them nor do I see a need to.  I have not yet had the opportunity to drive in bad winter conditions.    Ok, now to the negatives:  The MPG is not at all what I had hoped for.  The Renegade I had averaged about 26 MPG mixed use, and my wife's Crosstrek averaged about 31.  I am in 3000 miles right around 26 with 90% highway driving, sport mode off and eco mode on.  I will get 30-31 on a straight highway trip, but I am not impressed considering the Renegade got that, and in the Crosstrek we would be at 40+ mpg with straight highway driving.  I did not have either of those vehicles long enough to ""break them in"" either (both had around 10,000 miles when we traded them in, and I was getting that kind of gas mileage from the start).  So I would say the HR-V falls short in terms of MPG.  Also, the back seat is just plain awful.  Yes, there is good leg room and head room (awesome actually), but the seat design is uncomfortable.  The head reads fold down into the seat to provide the driver with better rear views.  If you have someone sit in the back seat, you have to pull the head rests up.  The seat back is still very low with the head rest providing most of your upper back support.  It has a jump seat feel to it .. it might work for kids, but as a 5'10, 200 lb. adult, I found it to be very uncomfortable.  Another complaint is that there are cheap materials throughout the vehicle.  The deck of the cargo area is practically felted cardboard.  I purchased the OEM cargo trey/liner which was not any better.  The carpeted floor mats the vehicle came with are cheap so I purchased weather tech mats.  My number 1 complaint is that with the LX non-leather version I have, the door sills are upholstered with fabric instead of a wipe able surface.  This means that if it is raining and you open the door, it gets soaked.  Since its fabric, it holds the moisture.  I had to exit my vehicle in a parking lot downpour and the door became completely soaked.  I am concerned how this will hold up over time.  I also feel that Honda could have done better with the ground clearance. I bought a crossover AWD vehicle to handle NE Ohio snowstorms, beach driving, and the occasional camp road or muddy event parking field.  With 6.7"" ground clearance there is no chance for beach driving.  Yes, I knew this going into buying the vehicle ... but considering the HR-V's competitors all have 8+"" of ground clearance, I feel like they missed the mark.  I have scraped the underside of the nose on some parking space curbs - in my opinion that shouldn't happen with a crossover.  Hopefully with the next generation HR-V, Honda will have made these small little tweaks which would turn an adequate crossover into a great one.  By then, I'll probably have traded it in for a Renegade or Crosstrek.",4.0,Honda,HR-V,2016,gasoline,141.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,SUV,35,28,2202,22065,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Honda HR-V 4dr SUV FWD (4cyl)

I had my heart set on a WRX, at least it was until I took a test drive of this Si.  I admittedly didn't have the highest of expectations for it going in with what I had set my bar to, but I was completely blown away in every regard in the first five minutes of driving it.  I've read a lot of reviews that the naturally aspirated 2.4L engine was lower on power than its direct competitors, but I'm never left wanting when I put my foot down (the lack of a turbo means no turbo lag!).  The light weight of the body, and the short throw shifter makes the 205 BHP feel like more than it is.  The engine and exhaust give the car a subtle, deep sound without being excessive or annoying to those in the car or around you, an excellent soundtrack for a windows open, evening cruise.  The interior is surprisingly roomy for a compact sedan, the fit and finish is spot on as one has come to expect from Honda, the red/black two toned interior with the Si logo stitched in the seats, and the red gauges are a nice touch.  If I had to make a complaint (and trust I'm having to reach for it on these), the front seats aren't the most comfortable for people with broader shoulders like myself, the audio could use a bit deeper of a sound, and the volume control on the touch display is a bit of a pain (easily remedied by using the steering wheel controls though).  I'm generally very picky about the cars I drive, as a result, I've swapped cars more often than I care to admit, but I genuinely feel like I've found the perfect vehicle with this Si.  You immediately get the feeling that the Civic Si is a love letter from Honda to people who enjoy driving.  A vehicle developed by car enthusiasts for car enthusiasts, still equipped with the modern safety features that DoT requires, without sacrificing the driver experience.  Each gear change has that satisfying mechanical click to it, every turn of the wheel feels tight and responsive, and plenty of power when you need it.  As long as I keep my foot out of it, I still even manage to get mid 30s on fuel economy.

The VCM (variable cylinder management) system is kinda clunky and going from a smooth CVT to this led me to believe I was having transmission issues. This is not the smoothest SUV. It does great in every other gear but when I hit 20mph and downshift into 1st gear (I believe) there is an audible clunk that you can feel. It was a little annoying but only because I previously owned a Ford Explorer with tranny issues that started similarly to this. After taking it in to be looked at, it was explained to me that this is normal. With the car constantly turning off and on 3 cylinders, it does make the ride ""less smooth"" but you get better fuel economy in exchange. I will say that it's a great highway cruiser with lots of nooks, crannies and cargo space. The A/C blows cold as soon as you start it up! (Even in the hot VA summer.) I love the interior of the new pilot. It's a huge step up. The interior is a little dated. I would've waited a couple weeks and bought a 2016 but I don't want a mini van. Which is what all new SUV's look like nowadays. I had to choose between interior aesthetics or exterior aesthetics and I chose exterior. I want my SUV to look like a SUV.  Not a mini van. So, I chose the 2015 instead and got the square body SUV I know and love, but at the price of a dated interior. I do love this car. Aside from the VCM, I will say braking distance is poor, but it's s great vehicle overall. If the 2016 Pilot kept the same body style but updated the interior to what it is now, I would've bought a 2016 in a second.  This looks like the last true SUV in the market I'll ever be able to afford. I turned down a 2015 Pathfinder strictly due to the mini van design. Had the pathfinder kept true to its SUV design, I'd be the owner of one right now. I understand gas mileage is important. Especially this day and age. But, me personally... I'd rather sacrifice a few mpg and have a real SUV, not a minivanified SUV. Overall a great car. It has it quirks but it's super reliable and super comfortable and looks like a real SUV. What more could you ask for. I'd give it a solid B+ overall. Now is the time to buy a 2015 Pilot. With the new 2016, lots of dealerships are offering their 2015 models far below invoice price. The pilot has always been outside of my budget, but the 2016 Pilot's new designed changed that for me and allowed me to buy a car I could never afford. That's the only thing I like about the 2016 Pilot.UPDATE:Have now owned this vehicle for over a year. Have had no issues with it. If anything, it actually rides smoother after putting a few miles on it. I'm at 6,500 miles now. My opinion is the same. Great car, but the transmission could be tuned a little bit better. There is a slight delay between depressing the accelerator and the car actually moving forward.

I don't see what the fuss is about the radio not having ""buttons"", just use the steering wheel controls.  I bought a close out 2017 EXL as Edmunds recommended.  I passed on the sensing but went for the AWD.  No need to Nav or RES.  I was able to get 0.9% financing along with $1,500 below invoice using Costco pricing and haggling with 2 different dealers.  I looked at the Highlander and Acadia.  No contest.  Highlander is way to small and the GMC/Chevy don't hold their value.  Traded in our 2013 Toyota Sienna, which I thought was a pretty good vehcile, until I drove the Pilot.  After the test drive, I was hooked and had to have one.  Besides the ride and fit and finish, I really enjoy the apple car play and the how you can customize a lot of the settings in the radio.  That said, I have 2 gripes.  1. no 3rd row floormat AND you can't buy one from Honda unless you buy all the floormats?  So, I bought one from Lloyds mats ($34).  It is just really odd that this isn't included in the EXL.   2. No 12V acc plug in the 2nd row.  My 2005 has one, why not my 2017?

693, on 02/15/17 12:15 PM (PST),Ryan ,2015 Honda Fit Hatchback LX 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl 6M),The Modern Penalty Box," We bought our 2015 Honda Fit LX back in Oct. 2014, and finally sold it in February, 2016 after only 5,000 tedious miles.  This was our, as a young married couple, very first brand new car. We were excited to get it initially and had planned on keeping it for 10+ years..  Selling it so soon was bittersweet.   The Fit makes a good initial showroom impression; lots of space in the back seat and trunk, good value in the LX trim and well-equipped, and high fuel economy numbers.  After cross shopping a few other cars, we took a bet on Honda's solid reputation.             Problems arose within the first two weeks of ownership as an alternator went out and was defective.  The car was towed and fixed under warranty.  But more quality issues soon followed; the rear hatch trim snapped off a month later, rattles developed in the hatch and driver's door, the fuel gauge would not be accurate and would take days to register a fill-up, the tailights filled with water, the front bumper began sagging, the clutch pedal would always creak despite several attempts to fix it, and the headliner soon started detaching itself.     Most of these were covered under warranty, but the trips were annoyingly frequent and it was becoming difficult to keep with all of the needed repairs.  I’m very gentle on all my cars and have several older, well-preserved cars in our garage, and we were not abusive to the Fit.The Fit itself was also not a joy.  The engine seemed fine on the test drive on surface streets, but was exceedingly loud and slow on the freeway.  Much of this was the fault of the six-speed manual, which had very low, closely-proportioned fifth and sixth gears.  They were almost indistinguishable and resulted in the engine buzzing at 3,400rpm at 70mph.  All of the gears were too close and required constant shifting.  At the least the shifter itself was nice to shift through, and the clutch was buttery smooth.  The ride on this harsh with every bump felt and relentless road noise.  A long drive was just brutal in this car.At least the handling was superb for the car’s econo-car roots, and this was a fun car on a mountain road.  Steering was crisp, and the handling was safe, fast, and responsive.Inside, the back seat is huge, and the magic seat is a neat trick. The cargo area is voluminous and betrays the car’s small footprint.  Folding the seats down resulted in almost SUV-like storage capability.  You could easily do a house move in a Fit.But it was almost as though Honda’s engineers focused on the back seats, and the fronts were an afterthought.  The front seats would not go back far enough, and taller passengers would find their knees against the dash and foot squished up in the tight footwheel.  The driving position was equally awkward.  Controls were simple and straightforward, and easy to learn.  The materials on the dash and interior, especially the seats, felt pretty plush.Fuel economy was amazing, averaging 35mpg in the city, and 46mpg on some highway drives.  Amazing!But it wasn’t enough trade-off for the car’s general flimsy feel, poor gearing, sluggishness, tight driving position, and overall terrible quality.

First, you'll notice that the atkinson cycle engine causes a very slight lag between your gas peddle input and the engine actually engaging.  This is compounded because due to this lag, the transmission is not married well to the engine, as I got a few false upshifts and then immediate downshifts.  The second flaw concerns the interior build quality and layout compared to the Toyota Corolla.  I'm 6'1'' tall and noticed when i lean my right leg against the center console, it bows outward considerably compared to the corolla.  It feels like the middle console and dash are not secured together well at all.  I drove the corolla and pushed my leg hard against the console and it didn't budge.  The third comparison to the corolla is that despite having greater cubic foot interior, I could not sit in the back behind my driving position in the elantra, and could quite easily in the corolla, so that speaks to how well the space is utilized.

714, on 11/25/15 12:28 PM (PST),John ,2015 Hyundai Elantra Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6M),"Oh, the things they don't tell you! UPDATE"," After 5 months of driving this piece of garbage I traded it in and there will NEVER be a Hyundai piece of junk on my driveway again-I'll never even accept one as a rental. This thing drove like a beat up and worn out '68 station wagon. From the way under-designed suspension to the junk Continental tires, the car drove so bad that the handling was dangerous. Driving over a bump on the freeway, especially in a turn, required absolute concentration just to stay in my lane. All is well now, though. The car I traded it in for is a Nissan Altima, which is a fantastic car. Very well built and drives like a well made car should-which the Hyundai is not. I've had this car for about 6 months and it's ok, but there are a few things that will make it the last Hyundai I'll buy. First, the gas mileage. I do a lot of highway driving for work and so far the best I've gotten is 33.2 mpg. I drive around 70 in a 65 (any closer to 65 and I'd get run off the road) and I've found that in order for me to get better gas mileage I have to drive closer to 80. I don't get it. There seem's to be something wrong with the gearing for this to occur, or maybe electronics, but this makes no sense. Secondly, this so called ""10 year, 100,000 mile warranty"" that Hyundai pushes was attempted to be added by the salesman or sales manager to my contract. I was told it came with the car, but what I wasn't told was it was going to cast me an additional $6K!! This was after they told me the honor Truecar estimates and then tried to add $5K to the price of the car. (They said it had extras not on the estimate until I showed them the VIN number on the estimate was the same as the car on the contract.) After 2+ hours of getting a tad hot under the collar I got the price without the bogus warranty. Then I got home and found out there was no spare. Just a repair kit that you can't use since the majority of tire failures happen on the freeway which pretty much destroys the tire. After finding out the ungodly amount of money Hyundai wanted for what should have been in the car (or at least I should have been told wasn't in the car) I found everything on Ebay for less than half.As for form fit and function, the car's not bad. It's quiet and comfortable. I have the sport and popular packages so it has the sunroof, fog lights, etc.. Throttle reponse is weak, though, and sometimes the transmission jerks on acceleration as if the car doesn't know what gear it should be in. The suspension is weak. Real weak. The Hancook tire are also garbage. When I encounter a rough patch on a curve I have to be ready because this thing will jump all over the place. Also the ""slip angle"" of the tires on turns is terrible. There's 2 more things to buy.The sound system is ok. The volume capability is less than half of what it should be. To have any decent volume just to listen to talk radio it needs to be just short of full blast. And no I don't have any hearing problems. Also the controls are designed to cause accidents. If you want to say lower the bass, park first because you'll be tapping the screen controls that are badly placed and too small for driving just to get to the small, badly placed buttons to make the adjustments. This will be corrected with a small amplified equalizer in the center console compartment-one with knobs so you don't have to take your eyes off the road. Yet something else to pay for that shouldn't be an issue.Anyway, for me this car is a swing and a miss. With the other quality cars out there that granted cost a bit more, Hyundai comes up lacking. Best warranty in the business? Maybe, but they need to make it clear that it will cost you dearly. Not inform the buyer there's no spare, because I've yet to meet anyone that asks if there is one? Major issue. How many husbands would like to find out while out with the family or from your wife because she's on the freeway with a shredded blow out? Change the station and you want to lower the blasting bass? Don't even think about it if your driving. Hit a bump on the freeway? Hang on brother or you could be modifying the body style real quick. Sorry Hyundai. As long as these  types of things exist in your sales staff and vehicles, I'll be driving Honda's.

The ride is smooth and the 2.0L 173 Horsepower Engine is the same engine used for the 2.0L Turbo-Charged 245 Horsepower Engine used in the 2015+ Sonata.  So minus the boost from the turbo, the engine is respectfully peppy, in particular when used in the sport shifting mode, keeping the engine in its maximum torque range, (3500 to 4500 RPM).  It makes a very nice jump on to the highway.  The digital steering control allows you to switch the steering feel mode from Normal> Comfort> Sport. Its a nice touch, in particular for a little fun on the curvy back-roads in my county.The sound system is quite good for the stock stereo system.  It really doesn't need much more than it has.  I would only add that some slightly better quality speakers would indeed make a difference.  I say this because I spend much time in this vehicle and have a tendency to bring a laptop and watch movies with a patch-cord jacked into the AUX Outlet, to plumb sound through the vehicle's sound system.  Needless to say action films tend to tax the speakers a little bit, so mine might be visiting my local stereo shop for a minor upgrade in that department.For this aspect I have to be realistic.  Understand the Elantra GT is not based on the same body as the sedan.  The vehicle is actually physically shorter by nearly a foot in length.  So the back seats in this vehicle are OK for young kids, but teens or adults, forget it!  I have fairly long legs, so the seat on the driver's side is nearly all the way back.  However, if you are like my wife and I, and have no children, then this aspect really doesn't matter.The cargo area is great, I have no issues this this department.  The rear seats in the hatchback have a double fold procedure to make the rear cargo area extremely large.

The only maintenance I've had to do to the car is regular oil changes, tires and an occasional air filter.  I get between 27 -30 in the city and that is with occasionally driving like a bat outta hell. I don't do much highway driving but I could only imagine how awesome it would be.

744, on 02/27/17 18:06 PM (PST),Tim ,2017 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),After 3 months we really like it," We were looking for a mid-sized SUV to replace our 2004 Toyota Highlander which we loved. We test drove the new Highlander and thought that was hard to see over the dash and the engine lacked power. We investigated the Honda Pilot but it looked huge, was really expensive and the dealer wouldn't budge much from MSRP. The dealer actually bragged about the fact that they sell near MSRP. So we decided to try the Hyundai Santa Fe even though we had never owned one before, based on internet and Consumer Reports reviews. I had previously driven an older Hyundai Santa Fe model as a rental and had liked it. So we picked out the Santa Fe SE with the Premium Package based on features/price and found a local dealer in Massachusetts. They gave us a great quote over the Internet, just a bit over invoice price. You can still figure out dealer invoice prices using a site like MSN Autos. Don't bother using sites like True Car, they basically give dealers a lead on your business and not the best price for you. We did much better looking directly at dealer sites.  The Hyundai dealer was great, very helpful in all aspects of the purchase. All the features we got with the Santa Fe would have easily cost $10K more on the Honda Pilot. We've had the Santa Fe about 3 months now through the NE winter. The AWD is excellent in the snow and the V6 is really powerful on the highway. It cruises at 85 mph easily. We've driven to northern Vermont, and Maine. It has a very comfortable quiet ride. Not sure why other people were complaining about wind noise I haven't heard it. The rear and 3rd row seats split to allow you to put skis in, very useful as you can still get 5 people in the car with skis. Kids in the 3rd row only though. The ride is not super sporty but it has a good road feel. The safety features are excellent. Rear view camera and proximity warning systems on the side mirrors work great. My only minor complaints are that the electronic dash system is a bit complicated, the front seatbelt clips are a bit low and I don't like the feel of the leather steering wheel. Also, you can only listen to the radio about 10 minutes without the engine running, the it shuts off. I think I will get used to all these issues over time. Overall the Santa Fe is an excellent SUV choice, I definitely recommend test driving one.",5.0,Hyundai,Santa Fe,2017,gasoline,290.0,6,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,22,17,1439,36700,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2017 Hyundai Santa Fe 4dr SUV AWD (6cyl)

The comfort, ride and amenities are great.  The new Santa Fe Ultimate is larger than previous vehicles and four adults can ride comfortably.  The third row seating is great if you have little ones.  Your front seat and backseat passengers can control their own heat/cooling, which is great - I like it warmer and others like it cooler, so everyone is happy.  Haven't had the chance to drive in the snow yet, but, if it is anything like the previous Santa Fe's, I won't have a bit of trouble.  Weather in Denver can get nasty in the winter, but the Santa Fe's have always taken on the cold and snow like a champ.  My only complaint would be the tires.  I usually replace them, as they don't seem to have the tread for winter weather; other than that, I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a larger SUV.",5.0,Hyundai,Santa Fe,2016,gasoline,290.0,6,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,24,18,1439,32150,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Hyundai Santa Fe 4dr SUV AWD (6cyl)

If you google this issue with infiniti there are pages and pages of complaints about problems with iPhone integration. Given that there a billion iphones out there, pretty strange.

Infiniti blew us away with the use of getting to the third row and the amount of legroom in the third row compared to the MDX.

It had all of the options we wanted (AWD, strong power, look of luxury) so we opted for the new model instead of the outgoing G model.  Overall the car is great with the exception of electronic systems that are the center piece of the interior.  I have never seen a car's systems take so long to come online.  Once you start the car, at best, all of the radio functions will finally become available after about 30 seconds to a minute.  Also (and I find this to be hazard that Infiniti should fix), the back-up sensors and grid also take about 30 seconds to a minute to become available.  When you are in a crowded shopping area and your first action when leaving is to back out of the parking spot, all safety systems should be immediately available.  Our other car's (not an Infiniti) backup systems, radio and all other electronics are immediately available at the turn of the ignition.  Even when the electronics are available, the Q50 has several glitches.  When we first got the car, the radio would ""freeze"", meaning once you turned to a station, you could not switch stations or even turn the volume down without stopping the car, turning it off and restarting.  I think they finally fixed that issue with one of the several updates, but we still have glitches in the radio and controls from time to time.  I think the Q50's navigation system is significantly better than the one in our other car and is extremely user-friendly and easy to use while driving.Overall a good car with impressive power, comfort and other features, but as a new model, it has some needed improvements that likely will not be available for another model year or two.

In order to keep your feet from sweating the outside vents have to be closed & the interior temperature is controlled by the center & floor vents (this is the only way to lower the temperature without having cold air come out of the Side Vents). Having the side vents closed makes your arm closest to the door cold when the outside temperature is in the 40s, unless you are wearing a jacket.  I brought the vehicle back to the dealer I purchased it from they kept it for 4 days & told me that was normal.  I placed a temperature gauges in the vents & photographed the Outside Airtemp reading and interior controls documenting the issue, I took the vehicle to another Infinity Dealer with the Presentation that illustrated the temperature difference between vents.  The Service Adviser was great he contact the Infinity Rep & validated my concern.  After another 24 hours without my vehicle the Answer from Infinity = all the QX80s have the same issue it is normal.  It maybe normal for the QX80 however my Lexus or Toyota do not have a 20 degree split between vents, nor do I remember any other vehicle I have owned.

The car is very comfortable to drive, i especially enjoy the option of the extended seat for the back of the legs on long trips.  i didnt think much about that until i used it and it was very comfortable.   As simple as this may be, the headlights on the car are very good, and you can see a good distance with them.  I find that the navigation and UVO system is very finicky and i am having trouble with the voice recognition (how does call home turn into call Paul?), maybe i just do not know how to use it yet, but i would think it would be self explanatory.   The car has very good acceleration for the V6, especially when you are at highway speeds.  I have the paddle shifters, but havent used them nor am i sure why they would be on this car, i cant see too many buyers of this car using them.  I am currently getting 25.5 mpg in normal mix driving of highway and city, so that was a surprise to me, was expecting less.

Wow, first off this minivan has the most quiet ride of all minivans we drove, period!!  And it doesn't look like a minivan, it has a bolder stance and just down right cooler looking!   Tons of features! Love the cooled seats.. Navigation system is one of the best we have had in any of our cars!  Easy to get in and out of with three Children.   Memory driver seat is great because my wife is 5' and I'm 5' 10""....   This minivan has too many awesome features to list.  We purchased this mainly for an extra vehicle and it will used mostly for vacation road trips.  The only downside and it's really not a negative is that you may need some time to figure out all the technology that it has.  I can predict this will be the number 1 minivan on the market once people give Kia the opportunity.   We also have a Kia Optima SXL and it's been perfect in all ways.   Will follow up in a few months.Update: after 6 months and only 2995 miles it has been amazing!  Two road trips and the highway mpg is great at 25-26.  Our three kids watch the built DVD with wireless headsets and then play on xbox 360 while my wife and I can listen to music and talk!  Kia did an awesome job with designing this minivan for families!!!  Very pleased with this purchase, my wife needed a very safe minivan with technology and this was by far the best on the market!  She doesn't drive much, just the kids to school and around our area for shopping.   At first she thought it was a little too big, but with the cameras she just loves it.  I like it so much that I may sell my Optima SXL and buy another for me.Update after 1 year:   This has been an incredible minivan from day one.   It is super quiet while driving with very little road noise if any.   We have taken it on several road trips and I'm amazed that it gets 26 mpg on the highway!   Still enjoy all of the technology and most of all the safety features.  We feel very safe while driving this minivan.  I really don't have anything negative to report.

The #1 reason that I chose Kia is that they do not use the CVT transmission that all of the other brands in it's class does. The 1.8L engine has plenty of power even with the air conditioner on high and with passengers. The interior is very nice for a base model and the popular package gets you a lot, including backup camera, Bluetooth, etc. Trunk space is best in it's class. If you can get a 2016 with the PP for under $18K you will not regret it and remember the transmission! CVT 's wear out at around 70,000 miles and cost around $7000 to replace (they cannot be repaired) perhaps this is why Kia chooses to not to use them because of their 100,000 mile warranty, KIA uses the dual clutch transmission. The hand controls are very ergonomic which helps keep your eyes on the road. Kia does not deal with Takata Airbags (look up Takata Airbag Inflators) I cannot express enough about staying away from any auto that is equipped with the CVT transmission. Kia along with Mobis (a German engineering company) have engineered great autos.The Cons: I only have only 1 and that is when driving the Forte all you see is the road which is great for an experienced driver, but for a beginner they are bound to miss judge resulting in hitting curbs etc.",5.0,Kia,Forte,2016,gasoline,201.0,4,MANUAL,FWD,2,Compact,Coupe,29,22,1720,20690,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,2016 Kia Forte 2dr Coupe FWD (4cyl)

814, on 03/02/16 21:14 PM (PST),Tyler ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),More than I expected from a new mid-sized sedan," I leased this car after my 2002 Ford Taurus was finally put to rest.  I grew up riding in that car as a kid, it was my first car, and I broke 200k miles in it; bear that in mind as you read this review.  When I test drove this car, my first impressions were that the steering was loose, the interior was excellent, and it was far and away the best looking midsize sedan in its class alongside the Ford Fusion.  I liked it, and it was the cheapest lease deal I found, believe it or not.  With taxes/fees etc. I paid $1000 down and $177 a month for a two year lease.Performance-wise, this car met my expectations.  The 2.4L puts down 192 HP and 181 ft-lbs of torque.  It accelerates as hard as I'd ever want or need it to, and I never have problems passing people.  The brakes, as in any proper new car, are fantastic.  Thankfully this car has a true automatic transmission instead of a CVT (which I can't stand) and it even has the option to go into a pseudo-manual mode.  The tranny searches for gears very rarely.  The steering, like I said before, is really loose.  I got used to it, it really isn't that big of a deal.  Test drive one and you'll see what I mean.  The steering is probably the biggest point about this car to be debated.The seats are excellent.  They hold you in when you throw the car through a corner and they keep you comfortable on long road trips.  The rear seats are good too.  There is a good amount of leg room for its class.  It rides as smooth as you'd expect it to for a mid-sized sedan.  The headlights are FANTASTIC.  It has HIDs for the standard lights, and halogens for the high beams.  What's nice about this car is it has fog lights as a standard feature.  Unfortunately, they really don't do a whole lot.  I can barely notice the difference with them on, even in fog/rain/darkness, but it doesn't matter anyway because the normal lights work so well by themselves.  I think Kia just put them there as a way to ""one-up"" other car companies. They make it look better.The rear visibility is not that good, for some reason.  Blind spots and forward visibility is great, but rear visibility seems limited.  You can still see fine, but the field of view is smaller than what I'm used to.  There is no standard rear view camera.  A lot of other new cars have this as a standard feature, which is something to keep in mind.  The bluetooth feature is nice because I've never used it before on my phone.  It is all very intuitive once you set it up at the dealership.  The stereo is...not that good.  It works fine and enjoy listening to it, but it definitely isn't the best.  Changing the bass/treble/middle etc. doesn't help much.  This is probably the worst feature of the car, and thankfully that isn't saying a whole lot.  It came with 3 months of free satellite radio, which I didn't really care about.  I listen to my radio stations, iPod, and CDs.  All are very easy to use in this car.The climate controls are great.  Everything is set up intuitively and it warms up/cools down the cabin quickly when I want it to.  The interior materials themselves actually surprised me.  There is quite a bit of soft and hard touch materials in this interior, and it was designed really well.  It is a really pleasing place to be.  My grandpa wouldn't shut up about it when I took him for a ride, he thought he was riding in a Cadillac.  It's designed really well but at the same time you know you aren't in a high end luxury vehicle either.  To be fair, there isn't a whole lot of cheap plastic - they instead opted for a lot of leathery-like materials and it really looks good.The tires are just a standard all-season, Nexen (Korean tire).  Nothing to write home about, but it isn't anything less than I'd expect.  This car does as well as I'd expect it would in the dirty, snowy, icy winters Buffalo is famous for.  I don't underestimate the importance of the quality of tire you put on your vehicle, and I have to say I'm pleased with how these tires (and the car in general) have gotten me through the winter.  They aren't outstanding, but they get the job done.I get 29 mpg in this car and I drive it pretty hard.  I'd say I have a 70% highway 30% city mix, and I drive fast on the highway (65-75 mph).  When I actually do the speed limit, I get 33 mpg in this car with 87 octane.  I'm pleased with that, considering how spirited of a driver I am.To sum up, I'd say the strengths of this car are how incredibly good looking it is, and how attractive and intuitive the interior is compared to the other cars in its class.  Its weakness is its sound system.  I'm an enthusiast and would rather be driving a Subaru WRX or Focus RS, but for now this is what I can afford that is new.  This car was everything I expected/wanted out of it.  I got this car because I needed something that wouldn't break down, (a new car) something that isn't terrible in the snow, (Front Wheel Drive) and was the cheapest lease deal I could find.",4.0,Kia,Optima Hybrid,2015,gasoline,199.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,39,35,1720,32150,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)
815, on 03/01/16 03:48 AM (PST),Michelle ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very Happy So Far," I bought this vechile 5 months ago after having a horrible experince with the Chevy Cruise. The car itself is by far prettier than the chevy. I love the look of it and the colour. The interior is a bit light so I sprayed sctoch gard on it in hopes that will persver the life of it. But the seats clean easily and well to my surprise. The inside cabin has a nice and comfortble feel. I like the seats. The passenger seat sits low but that is good considering my husband is 6""7 so this provides him with comfort for his head. Plenty of leg room.My son and his buddies say the backseat is very comfortable. They actually perfer sitting in the back. I do think the seats could had used a little more cushing. Newer cars get less good gas mileage and thinner seats...every year it gets worse. The radio does not have good sound quality and I would had excepted more from the cars price range. But I love everything else.The car itself stops perfectly. I had a car pull out in front of me and I thought well there goes my new car and I hit the brake and came to a comfortable complete stop. I couldn't believe it. The other car kept driving like I wasn't even there. The pick up is great even on the economy. I've taken it off the economy a couple of times for a day at a time just to see and it doesn't really see to effect the gas much at all and gives a nice extra boost. I really like the smooth drive of the car. Very nice. The inside cabin is a big nosier than excepted but I honestly really love this car.I'm so glad I bought it. It is fun, handels well, safe and it looks nice. Inside and out. Plenty of storage in the trunk and the glove box and the arm rest. I really like this car.The only thing I would really consider when buying this is the gas mileage is poor. I average about 19mpg. There is a bar to help you see how you drive for the gas mileage and initially I was getting about 28mpg but the snow birds are here so that makes stopping and going mading and well it has dropped quite a bit. That I'm not really happy about but what are you going to do?Still would buy the car again.

No problems at all. Seating is comfortable. Power's fine at 192 horses.  Gas mileage is good, mine are mostly highway miles. Road noise is a little louder than I'd like, but its not an upscale vehicle, more of a very adequate one.  That is what I sought when I purchased it.Updated on 2/1/17...so, I like the car very much; I describe it as driving like a BMW.  Don't know if that's true, but the car runs well without problems and accelerates adequately.  The dealer, however, in repairing a latch on the underbody engine shield charged $166.  I wonder since I never hit anything whether that was an appropriate charge. Wasn't like I hit a pothole and such circumstances beg the question as to whether the engine latch failed under normal driving conditions.  Plan to write the dealership owner. Other than that I love the car.",4.0,Kia,Optima Hybrid,2015,gasoline,199.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,39,35,1720,32150,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

So based on all these miles I've driven there are a few things that have happened along the way. It's a good car I haven't had much trouble with it. I would probably buy again. So here's what you guys look for in a review...the issues . 1. It doesn't come with a spare tire.  (found that out the hard way). 2. At 140 thousand miles the ac compressor went out costing me right at 1000 dollars to fix.  Now something is going on with the front end I have an appointment to have that looked at tomorrow. The clear coat is peeling off in several places and there is a rust spot on the hood. The interior has held up nicely still like brand new. The car runs great overall!  I loved it when I bought it and I still love it.. Just the body issues such as the clear coat and the rust spot have kind of gotten me a little upset.

I bought this car after extensive research, because of it's beauty, driver mode control and shifting capability.  It's not often discussed, but the Optima has 3 modes which the driver controls with the push of a button.  Economy, normal and sport mode.  This is extremely important to me because the car suits the mood I'm in at the moment and responds in kind.  For example, if I need the power, sport mode gives an immediate throttle response with high RPM's; I can suck all the horsepower it can give.  If I'm mellow and want a smooth ride while saving on gas, I switch to ""eco"" mode.

We cross shopped the XC90, GL 450 and this has all the features we wanted at literally half the price!  We rented a loaded Volvo for a week and couldn't wait to give it back, so many minor annoyances.    Kia is tops with CR and JD Power, and the safety features are top shelf.   If you have a family, you simply have to test drive a Sorento.  Tons of safety features, powerful v6, super comfortable ride and whisper quiet cabin.

I honestly don't know know they are making money at the prices these are selling for.     Lastly I will say this,  the Sorento and Cayenne sit side by side in our garage.

829, on 01/17/17 03:00 AM (PST),John ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Sorento - Economical Luxury," Goal was to find a reliable, well appointed, 3 row, mid-sized SUV AWD to replace a 2000 Honda Odyssey (200K miles).  After considerable research I narrowed the search to a 2016 Kia Sorento 3.3V SX/SXL and the 2015/16 Toyota Highlander XLE. Test drove both a new 2016 Kia Sorento EX and a used 2015 Toyota Highlander XLE within minutes of each other. Was surprised the 2016 Kia Sorento had better ride as well as safety features not available on Toyota Highlander till 2017. With mid-sized 3 row SUV prices over $40K sought an under 20k mile used Sorento SX or SXL. Again Kia had the edge since the 2nd owner receives the balance of the 5 year, 60K bumper-to-bumper new car warranty vs the Highlander 3 year, 36K mile warranty. Was fortunate to find an under 20K 2016 Kia Sorento SXL AWD for $33.5K.  I am pleased to report that after 22 months and 23,000 miles of driving our Kia Soretno SXL the overall mpg is to 23.5. On only long trip from Boston to Washington D.C. the 2016 Sorento averaged an incredible 32 mpg in both directions.  As for the features love the incredibly quiet and smooth ride, 3rd row, large clean back-up camera, wife's favorite is the heaated steering wheel for cold winter morning short work drive. Other nice features include side mirror lane departure sensors, cross check sensors, heated and cooled seats (front & back), no hands tailgate lift, small turning ratio. Everyday wife drives and more and more pleased with this vehicle purchase. So far standard maintenance, there has been a few free manufacturer recalls. Only repair issue has been the panoramic sunroof tracking. Have had it grease when I first got SUV and then in -8F the roof wouldn't only close after manual intervention. Trip to dealer and found there is a manufacturer recall for this issue.

830, on 03/20/16 08:37 AM (PDT),Jon ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Some Good and Some Not as Good," We’ve had the Sorento 14 months, and our impressions are some good and some not as good.  We have not had to take the car back to the dealer for a single problem--which is probably the single most important good thing about the vehicle.  It is a well built vehicle.First the good things:1. Love the body design and overall exterior and interior look of the vehicle.2. The ride is very smooth and quiet, with ample power for passing and hopping onto the freeway.3. Gas mileage is above what they rated it to be.  We’re getting over 25 mpg on highway and 21-22 in the city.    and that's in the 7 passenger, 6 cylinder, 3.3 liter SX 4. It has a very short turning-radius for that long a vehicle.5. There’s ample leg-room in all 3 rows of seats, but the headroom (with a sunroof) is a little too low in the 3rd row of seats.6.  I like the manual shifting capability.  It makes driving on winding mountain roads a lot easier on the brake pads.7.  The blind-spot warning and reverse warning systems work well to assist in driving.  The visibility when backing up is not as good as we'd like, so the backup camera and warning system help in that regard.8.  I like that the leg room along the ""hump"" (console area) next to your right leg is much better than in many of the other vehicles we test-drove--like the Nissan Murano and Infiniti  QX30.       Some of the not so good features are:1.  Entering and exiting the 3rd row seats is a slightly difficult.2.  The front seats are a little too firm, and the power lumbar is slightly noticeable even when fully contracted.3. The steering wheel position could be allowed to go lower and farther out.4.  I liked the CVT transmission on our traded in Murano, so I do miss that smooth, quiet shifting.",5.0,Kia,Sorento,2016,gasoline,290.0,6,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,SUV,26,18,1720,38300,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Kia Sorento 4dr SUV FWD (6cyl)
831, on 03/17/16 18:38 PM (PDT),Rachel ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),A car that gives you peace of mind!," If I told you about the past three cars I had before my Sorento, you wouldn't believe my bad luck. I still walk out of the store and thank god ""Black Betty"" is there to greet me. We bought this car less than two weeks before moving across country. We went with two rows. Just my husband and myself, and a bunch of fur babies. We looked at every car out there. New/used. We stayed away from anything 45k and above. We had about 10k-12k to put down. Our options were open. Initially my husband test drove the Sorento. While I was impressed/size with the appearance I was favoring the sleek and sexy body/look of the Nissan Altima. Obviously the two cars aren't a like at all. We did need space. I went over the Pros and cons. I'll share them with you now. Pro: Space, the large trunk offers much more space than most SUV's without removing seats. The body is sexy, it looks nice. People are always caught off guard by the brand.The interior is really detailed. I love the two tone. Black and tan with tan seats and black carpets. Even the 4cl has some kick when you want it to move.It rides so smooth. Not as great as my Lincoln, but come on it was a Lincoln!Interface has many options to choose fromMode for gas: eco, sport, regularEase of getting in and out. My grandmother loved how you could just slip in and out. Many options for power, you can all have your devices plugged in at once. The seats are comfortable, you don't feel stiff and unable to move freely. The backup camera, something I never thought I would use, is very useful.Leg room for passengers is always a pro. The movement of the second row allows people in the backseat to relax and not feel stuck.Gas is pretty good. We drove over 4000 miles from South Carolina to Washington State, making stops in both Arkansas, and Illinois. That's not an easy drive in any car. With 6 animals. I wouldn't have chosen any other vehicle to have done it in. we got 27.8 miles per gallon. I'll take it. ---ConsThe wind with knock you over, no really if it's windy let off the gas. I feel like for a brand new car the headlights lack in visualizations. The speed on the windshield wipers is not up to par, in fact I consider them almost dangerously slow. The sound system could be better. I will have to have it replaced with a better system at some point. It's lacking in every way.(The Sounds system for years it seems on Kia models has come with issues, you have to reset it with a pin (pointed object, being inserted into a tiny hole) Or there will be no sound, from ipod's cd's ect..Front grill isn't east to clean. Took many car washes to get the bugs off of the grill. I spent almost $30.00 just trying to removed them. There is still residue. If you have pets HUGE annoyance ""You can't leave your keys in the car and lock the door, thus leaving the air on."" If your keys are in the car your doors will not lock. Auto lock doors. Great for when you run in a store and forgot to lock your doors, not great for when you run back into the house to grab your purse. Mostly the cons are dumb things that are more annoyances that come with learning more about your car. The first three are my only real gripes.Over all. I think we went with the best choice. The price was worth it. Not over priced, not over sized. I like the kia community. We have had a really great experience with out service provider. Our car is nice enough to feel luxurious, but not well known enough to be targeted. As silly as that sounds. When you're from Chicago you learn the little things are important. It's great that it can fit into small spaces, tow a camper, lug 25 2x4's. Or just move a family across the continental United States. It handles nicely, it rides better and smoother than most SUV's I've ever been in. Mostly I feel safe when I take her out everyday. Nothing feels better then knowing not only am I in a car with great crash test ratings, but if she breaks down Kia has my back.

You cant beat the warranty and I think the build quality is good. There is only 2 dealers near where we live so we went to the closest one first to take the 2017 out for a test drive. When we first seen the car we loved the way it looked and the inside was even better (we looked at a Hyundai before we went to the kia dealer and they are almost the same) the problem I had was when I turned the key and heard the noise the engine made. It was HORRIBLE, I have a strong mechanical background and the tapping noise the car makes inside and out is unacceptable to me. What it is is the high pressure injection system (fuel pump and injectors) . Now if you know nothing about machinery you may not notice the noise this makes and if so buy the car it is a good car I am just giving my opinion about the fuel system. Now the dealer will try to tell you that this noise will stop after the car has warmed up but this is just not true, They may also say that this is new technology but this is also false. All I am asking is you research direct inject systems and educate yourself on the positives (and there are a bunch) and on the negatives.

I typically drive a Chevy Suburban.   I was surprised at how much gas I had to put in that little Kia. I didn't calculate the fuel mileage but feel like I was gassing up just as much as my big Chevy.  The engine has some get up and go but sounds like a weedwhacker under hard throttle.  First impressions pulling out of the parking lot was how quiet the car was. The interior quality seemed very good. It took me a while to figure out how to use the windshield wipers.  The temperature gauge was in Celsius and I could not figure out how to change that.  The suspension was firm but that's the way I like them.  The suspension seemed to handle well but the car felt top heavy and narrow.  Heading down the interstate the car felt a little twitchy as the steering was very quick and the narrow car seemed to want to change lanes at the slightest movement.  The triangular shaped side mirrors were infuriating I felt like half of my field of vision was chopped off and I had to duck my head around to see everything I needed to.  I tried to lower the seat to get comfortable but then realized the windows were too small and the bottom of the window was almost beside my ear.  I had to raise the seat back up so I could see.  Trying to use my phone as I GPS I could not find a place I could set it down where it would not fall on the floor or slide to the back of the passenger seat where it is too dangerous to look at.  This might be a nice car for a young single person or a first SUV but for a 45 years old father of 5,  I really didn't like it.

I had just moved and had a little bit more of a commute so I wanted something more comfortable than my Ranger, with better gas mileage.  When I started looking, what drew me in was the warranty and, as I looked more, the good reviews got me to test drive one.  I think the exterior can be somewhat polarizing but I like the look and I like the choice in colors besides black, blue, silver, white, and red.  Mine is copper and I think it looks great, and different from other cars on the road.  What really sold me on this SUV was the interior.  The quality, feel, fit and finish of the interior is outstanding.  It feels like a much more expensive vehicle than any sub $25k SUV has the right to be.  All the controls are laid out logically and you don't need an instruction manual to figure everything out.  You have multiple ways to control things, like the infotainment system.  On the base model LX I have a 5 inch touchscreen AM/FM/CD/SAT player with aux input, USB, bluetooth, and rearview camera.  I can control the system using the knobs and buttons, the touchscreen, or the steering wheel controls.  No cumbersome menus to go through, super simple to use and I think it sounds good.  As a plus I plug my iPod into the USB port and can also control it from the steering column.  The driver information system is controlled from the steering wheel and allows for a lot of adjustment to suit individual tastes.  The heating/AC system is also very easy to use and works well.  The LX only comes with single zone climate controls but I don't find that an issue for me.  The steering is nicely weighted and the handling is very good.  The six speed transmission is good and don't find it hunting for gears.   The main complaint that I see in professional reviews of the Sportage is the engine and gas mileage.  I think 181hp is more than adequate and I certainly don't have any trouble keeping up with California highway traffic in mine.  As for mileage, I commute about 13 miles one way to work on a back country, twisty 2 lane road with about a 1,000 ft elevation change and I average 25-26mpg.  I keep my Sportage in Eco mode and I didn't notice any difference in performance and I'm very happy that I can go over 2 weeks without having to fill it up.  Also, my Sportage is all wheel drive and I haven't noticed any mileage penalty for that either but I feel that it contributes to the great grip in corners that it has.  Another nice feature of the all wheel drive in the ability to lock the center differential which could come in handy this winter.  The LX also comes with standard with 17 inch alloy wheels which look great.  I would rate brake feel and overall braking as excellent.  The doors, both front and rear, have large openings that make entry and egress very nice, even for very tall people.  The drivers seat is very comfortable and has manual controls and nice shaping that even fits my large frame well.  Manual tilt and telescope steering column also allow the Sportage to adjust to a wide range of bodies.  The rear liftgate on the base LX isn't powered but I don't find that an issue.  The other major complaint I read about the Sportage was a lack of storage space, which was usually pegged at between 4-6 cubic ft less than it's competitors.  This hasn't been an issue for me and I think the storage space is more than ample for my needs and has plenty of tie downs to assist in organizing the space.  The base LX also has tinted rear windows and a soft cargo area cover to keep unnecessary eyes from prying.  Frankly, combining all these features on a base model LX with no options for less than $25k with Kia's outstanding warranty made this a no brainer for me.",5.0,Kia,Sportage,2016,gasoline,182.0,4,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Compact,SUV,26,19,1720,23650,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016 Kia Sportage 4dr SUV AWD (4cyl)

I do currently have 2 issues and 2 concerns. 1st main issue is the sun glasses holder, at random times it has a rattle like something broke off in it and is rattling around, but noticeable only really on roads that are not as smooth but is very annoying at times. Sometimes it makes noise sometimes it does not. 2nd is what sounds like coming from the back when going slowly over speed bumps or really bumpy roads like its the suspension but not sure. My 2 concerns is when turning off my car I hear a bubbling gurgling noise, I just recently recalled hearing it again since having to use AC. 2nd concern is my AC sometimes has a mildew smell but usually goes away after 30 seconds. Almost forgot somewhere around 30k my Poor rear passenger side window got shattered ohhh the glass everywhere, I think it was my dads fault as we suspect a rock may have flung up from the lawn mower, he felt bad and bought me a replacement from a wreaked Soul in Texas.

851, on 04/02/16 14:32 PM (PDT),Gary ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Great vehicle for the price," The 2016 Kia Soul performs better than expected . Interior space is better than expected for a vehicle of this size. Despite the reviews in regards to performance, the 2.0 power plant does a very good job for the normal everyday driver. I have managed to get 29 miles per gallon in town with light foot driving practices. The steering is very responsive and the four wheel disc brakes are much better than average. The ride comfort is a bit stiff on rough roads but acceptable. I would recommend the base+ if you don't need every bell and whistle available. The cost for additional packages is a bit costly in my view. The plus has the back up camera feature and touch screen on the dash. It also has fog lights and automatic headlight feature. I will comment on two areas for change in my view. The fact that the Soul does not have a spare tire is very important to me. The spare tire kit will cost you an additional $200.00. It is possible you could be setting for some time if you depend on roadside assistance. The spare tire will get you on the road in less time by far. The additional area I would comment on is the rear wheel well. The material that is used in the rear wheel well area is almost carpet like. It holds the mud and salt in our area and is hard to clean even with high pressure spray. I am concerned about this materials ability to hold up under mud, snow and gravel situations. It should be a heavy duty plastic like the front wheel well area. Overall it is a great vehicle for the money invested.

853, on 12/12/15 17:24 PM (PST),Brian ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Kia has officially blown me away," Let me preface this review with the fact that my daily driver is a BMW X5, and my previous vehicles were Infiniti JX and 2 Lexus GX470's.  So I tend to be very harsh when reviewing non-luxury cars (I absolutely can't stand my wife's Toyota Sienna, but then again, I don't have to drive it).  We purchased this car primarily as a third family vehicle now that our son is driving.  My goal was to find a nicely equipped vehicle with excellent safety and great visibility.  Honestly, I wasn't too concerned with interior quality, fit/finish or ride quality.  My goal was a decent car for around $20k.  We looked at quite a few different cars:  Mazda 3, VW Golf, Honda Fit, Honda Civic, and Toyota Corolla.After test driving the snot out of all the above named cars, we kept comparing everything to the Kia Soul.  We ended up purchasing a 2016 Soul + with the audio and primo pkg's and some add ons (MSRP $25,550) for $21,325.  We actually had an offer from a dealer that was 3 hours away for $20,680 but I didn't really feel like driving 6 hours round trip to save a few hundred dollars.  What floored me is the fact that the Kia Soul absolutely blows away the competition for what you get for the money.  The interior is excellent at this price point:  Leather seating, a mixture of soft touch, hard touch surfaces and a very intuitive navigation/entertainment system with a feature called Evo that allows you to set notifications on various parameters such as traveling outside of a certain geographic radius, driving over a designated speed or driving past a set curfew (all of which are excellent for keeping track of your young drivers), plus the feeling of a spacious cabin.  The ride is firm yet comfortable and cabin noise is far better then expected and the fact that for $21k you get auto on/off headlights, leather, navigation, keyless remote entry and keyless engine start, remote start, panoramic sunroof, upgraded audio system with subwoofer (that is actually pretty darn good), fog lights, LED interior lighting, speaker lighting, homelink rear view mirror, rear view camera, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, leather wrapped steering wheel, etc.  Simply put, the Kia Soul was far better equipped for the selling price vs. all of the other cars we considered (the VW Golf was close to $30k for similar equipment and still didn't include cooled seats or heated rear seats).My only complaint is the cheap Nexen tires that came on the vehicle.  They are pretty bad.  Within the first week, we had a pretty light rain and I was spinning the tires from a stop.  Needless to say, I took off the Nexen and put on Pirelli's and the difference in performance is not only night and day, but the road noise has improved as has the ride quality.  The point of my review is that Kia was never on my radar screen, but my wife thought that the Soul was cute and quirky so I drove it expecting to quickly cross it off the list.  I never expected this type of quality from a car that only cost $21,000.  I remember sitting in an MBA class about 5 years ago with a fellow student doing an analysis of Kia and thinking to myself that ""Kia will never be able to compete with the major automobile companies because they make cheap crap.""  Well, today I'm eating crow....  gladly.  They've given us a very nice vehicle for a reasonable amount of money.

Shortly sfter driving the car off the lot, I felt a vibration coming from the front of the car, immediately brought it back to Kia... They claimed that the tires were ""out of round"" because the car sat on the lot for so long. So they balanced the tires and told me to put miles on the tires and it would go away. I brought it back again... They replaced the tires, it still didn't fix the vibration. They replaced the wheels, then told me that the car was fine... I took it off the lot, and to my dismay, the fix didn't work... Then hey replaced the drive shaft... It still didn't work, the vibration was still there. Kia corporate got involved... They sent out a specialist, with a newly designed drive shaft.. Promised me that installing this newly designed drive shaft would work because they have had numerous customers that have had the same problem with their K900 models, and it fixed the problem 80% of the time....I had to wait for over 25 days for the drive shaft to be installed.... And it still vibrated... The magical drive shaft still didn't work.Kia finally admitted that this was a problem inherent to the car's design and engineering and that it will never cease to vibrate as it does. Furthermore, they informed me that The vibration is within the normal operating specs of the vehicle, and there was nothing more they could do to address it.All of the above transpired within two months of driving it off the lot. I just want to give them their car back, get my money back, so I can move on from this nightmare...they've refused to take it back. They've refused to give me my money back. It's been two months since they acknowledged that they can't fix the vibration... I now have to sue Kia to get them to take their defective designed car back and return my money.Don't waste your money or your time like I did.

But all in all, this car is amazing.The inside:My version, the LX, came with bluetooth support allowing me to connect my phone and call people without ever having to touch my phone. All you need to do is press a button on the wheel and say ""Call (whoever you're calling),"" it'll say back the name it heard and ask for verification. For some reason however, some people claim they can hear me just as well as if I had the phone to my ear, and others say it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel. The seats are plain looking, but surprisingly comfortable. My girlfriend has never been able to sleep in a car during a road trip- even overnight- until we went on a road trip in the Rio. The back seats are fairly average, though there isn't much space, however, three of my friends who are grown adult men were able to squeeze into the back, and didn't have many complaints.Driving:Driving this car is surprisingly fun.

Acceleration leaves something to be desired, but considering it's a 110HP engine designed to sip gas and give you 38MPG, it feels just right.Travelling noise gets gradually worse as the car gets higher in miles. When I originally bought it, it was very quiet. Now there's a lot of wind noise and the engine isn't as quiet as it used to be(still very quiet though).The engine:The number one complaint I've seen about this car in terms of the engine, is the ignition coils going out. The owners manual states that the spark plugs should be changed around 36000 miles. Most people don't change the oil in their car, let alone change the spark plugs or even do required maintenance. Unfortunately, I was one of those people around the 40,000 mile mark. My engine began to shake horribly and flashed the CEL. I had it towed to the Kia dealership(For free! Because Kia's roadside assistance for the first 60,000 miles), and they told me the spark plugs went out and it took the ignition coils out with it. They told me it was bad gas, and told me to only use Shell gas. Do not believe this. This was because the factory spark plugs don't last past 36,000(which is average for spark plugs, not a bad thing). They replaced the ignition coils for free because they were under warranty, but charged me $150 to replace the spark plugs. This is the ONLY thing I have had go wrong with the engine that wasn't somebody else's fault. Otherwise the Rio's inline-4 is reliable, and very easy to work on. Replacing the spark plugs cost me only $20 and about 20 minutes of time. It has 3 accessory belts, which is annoying, but they aren't hard to change and are relatively inexpensive.Overall:This car would make a wonderful starter car, and while it may not be the flashiest or the fastest car in the world, you can pick up a 2011 Rio for relatively cheap which makes it a perfect car for a first time driver, or a second car used to take on trips thanks to it's amazing fuel efficiency.",5.0,Kia,Rio,2015,gasoline,138.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,Sedan,37,27,1720,15190,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2015 Kia Rio 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

I liked the taller rear window in the Discovery and the cargo area better than the Evoque.  My first test drive I was unimpressed by the car's acceleration. However, after about 30 minutes on the test drive, I noticed the vehicle seemed responsive to my lead-foot antics. At the end of the test drive for the Discovery, I realized it was a very good value for a Land Rover family of cars vehicle.  I purchased my Discovery HSE Sport and have enjoyed it very much. According to the Land Rover Service Manager the vehicle is fitted with ""adaptive driving"" function with the transmission which I believe has caused my Discovery to be much quicker in starting off-the-line acceleration.  The only thing I don't like is the ECO feature which you must turn off to keep the vehicle running at a long stop light.  Otherwise, all is good. I found out the vehicle doesn't come with a cargo cover which is about $400. Nevertheless, I'm impressed overall and now realize I had saved a bundle of cash buying the Discovery over the Evoque.

We were going to lease the SE version(lowest end version).  We ended up getting another vehicle because most of the safety features and driver assist technology was absent on the SE model without spending very much more money to have them on this model.  Even the interior was sub par unless we jumped up to the HSE model.  We eventually decided against this vehicle because we would have paid as if we were driving a Land Rover while essentially getting a shell of a Land Rover.  One would expect a vehicle priced around 40K would be equipped with at least as many safety and driver assist features as a vehicle costing 10-15K less.  However, my wife's Mazda CX5 Touring has far more safety/driver assist features and drives just as nicely.

An NA V6 would get better mileage on a car of this size. The engine does have good torque and get up when the transmission is not getting in its own way so that you can merge or fight to the death on the 405 in intermittent traffic.

I realize this is a trend going forward, but it is making people worse drivers, including myself in this confounded thing. The interior quality is appalling for a car of this price.

Buttons connected to computer SLOW. Takes 2-3 seconds every time you press a button to respond.  Navigation takes up to 3 minutes to initialize after starting vehicle. Worst computer integration EVER!  Doors have unlocked and opened while driving!  Wow!Update:  Vehicle has been in service for about 50 days over the past 6 months for a multitude of problems.  The nav screen continues to reboot about every 2 hours of drive time.  They have no idea whats going on.  Have been told by service that this is a common problem.  The computer integration with all of the functions just blows!  To turn on the seat heat and massage, you have to go into the navigation screen!  I do not like my passengers touching my navigation screen.  Same with their climate control.  You can't just put all the functions into the nav screen.  Way too many steps to do much of anything.  I find myself thinking that I would like to do something, but it is just too much of a pain in the butt to do so.  The screens look like they were designed by a 12 year old.  A real pet peeve is that I like to see the navigation FULL SCREEN.  So, I press the screen to put it that way (getting rid of the road exit information).  Then every time I go to a different screen , or the navigation gives a direction, it goes back to showing the road exit information.  Petty?  Yes.  But just shows the lack of detail that went into this vehicle.  On the satellite radio, they put so much worthless info on it, that you don't see the name of the song, just the artist, and the channel number.  Really?  It's a large screen, plenty of room if they did it correctly.  I know that's minor, but, every little detail was ignored in this vehicle.  When you pay this much for a vehicle, it should be easy to use, fun, and informative.  Not at all.  My Hyundai Genesis has a navigation/computer integration that totally blows this away.  At less then half the price.  I prefer to drive the Hyundai!  That's pretty bad.After putting 18,000 miles on this vehicle, I have found this to be the most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned.  The seats are HORRID.  Like sitting in the cheapest airline seat.  This is a common comment from many passengers I've had.  It hurts to drive this vehicle for more than 2 hours at a time.  Your butt is just killing you.  There is NO padding in the front or rear seats because they cheapened it up so much to save weight.  My 2012 Range Rover SC was way, way, way better and nicer.

Had two services performed by dealer. Oil change at 6 months they came to my home. At 12 months they came by to pick up car and provided a loaner anf work done in 24 hours. Really enjoying the comfortable ride, great mileage per gallon, and not having to go for gas fillup every week. Sad to hear Lexus will not continue with this model in 2018.  Reliability, durability, fit & finish, technology and 40+ mpg sold us on this over the Prius Hatchback and V models we test drove. With a 5' tall driver they couldn't reach the hatchback on the Toyotas to close them. We thought with the Lexus brand the buying and post purchase customer experience would be as positive. Rather it has been inconsistent and requires me to have follow up individually with each department. Having the Lexus Certified Pre Owned 161 point inspection, 6 complimentary services over 30 months, and the extended 78 month warranty gives us confidence to many trouble free miles and a reduced Total Cost of Ownership.Update 9/08/17. Have had the car for over six months now and it still drives and feels like a new vehicle. Had the first of six complimentary maintenance services performed at my home. Based on the dealership's VIP program they send a Tech out to do minor service and will also provide a loaner care when major service is performed at the next 30K interval. Based on the Tech's recommendation the tires will have to be replaced in the next 6-12 months. They came with Michelin's and I'm researching whether or not to get Pirelli's or another brand.

This review reflects one month of ownership, so I can't speak to reliability just yet. The seating is comfortable, cargo space is adequate for my needs (holds about 7 grocery bags comfortably), and this car does MOVE. The vehicle has Eco, Normal and Sport modes. When I will be accelerating onto the highway, I switch to Sport to give the car an added boost. In stop and go traffic, I am in Normal or Eco mode. Changing modes is quick and easy using a dial on the console. Most operations for the radio or navigation can be done via the steering wheel or voice command. Unlike my previous car by another manufacturer, the car synched with my iPhone 6S quickly and easily and remains connected. Audio quality is good. There is ample leg room in the front and back. The back seat has its own air vents. There are some large blind spots and that does take getting used to, but the blind spot detection system is very helpful in that regard. Remote start is available, but only through the Lexus Enform Remote app. This is free for a year and then the price shoots up. Basically, you end up paying for a remote start over and over again, which I think is ridiculous. Overall, I continue to be impressed with the comfort and performance of this car and am so happy I traded up to a Lexus!UPDATE: I have now had this car seven months and have updated the reliability score.

I had grown accustomed to the small things in the ES, like the steering wheel getting out of the way and the seat moving back when I shut the car off. I liked the consistency of the instrument panel on each of the ES sedans. I am not concerned about going 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds. I want a vehicle that can get me into traffic and pass with some authority when needed. The 2015 NX 200t AWD is the vehicle that gives me the familiar comfort of the old, with the excitement of the new. It is refreshing to hit the gas in the NX and have the turbo kick in and put you back in the seat. The instrument panel has the same tachometer, speedometer, and info center as the ES. I like that familiarity. Some may expect something completely new. The Infotainment center is very intuitive. In a three hour highway drive, I was able to maneuver through the options without becoming distracted. I especially like the Enform auto start feature. I have read in past reviews that the auto start technology was ""old"" for a Lexus vehicle. I have used the I-phone App a number of times already and it worked flawlessly each time.If this is old technology and it works, I'm OK with that. Also, it was easy to download and sign up.The ride is smooth and quiet just as you might expect from Lexus. You can hear the turbo fire up for short time when you start up. It quiets down after a few seconds. One new thing I Like is the slightly stiffer ride in the NX compared to ES. It feels more like a sports car ride. finally for me, going to the CUV versus having a car has gone surprisingly well. I appreciate the access to the trunk area, my golf clubs do not have to be placed at an angle, and the jumper cables fit in with the spare tire. I have no regrets with my decision to go with the NX 200t.

Especially those who had an RX300 in the past, as i did, and found that their RX450 (or 350) is larger than they'd like. (and heavier too).    I've been a little frustrated with the way that Lexus has evolved.  The front grill is apparently designed with a younger generation in mind.  And car chassis keeps getting longer and wider, and less fun to drive.  So, i anticipated the NX eagerly, as the ""fix"".  Don't get me wrong.  The NX is fun to drive.  Smooth.  Handles well.  Accelerates nicely. And has the smaller footprint for parking and driving around town.2 problems are deal killers for me:  1) the cabin cargo area is too small for my large dog.  And specifically, not tall enough.  The RX300, while much smaller than my RX450, had a much taller cargo area than the 450.  The cargo height problem is much worse on the NX, making it a show stopper.   2) The other concern is that the front seats on the NX curve forward at the top, in a way i'm not fond of.  I could have gotten used to the seats, but the cargo area was a killer.Ironically, much smaller SUVs, like the  BMW X1, are better in cabin height - which is surprising.  And certainly the Audi Q5 and Mercedes GLC....   let alone the Subaru Forester offer far more viable choices for me and my dog.Frustrating as i'm a big Lexus fan of many years.

It really is the best of both worlds, although it can be a challenge to get in an out for some. The front seats are very comfortable, rear seats are pretty much reserved for kids or small packages. Like others have said, the navigation controls are a bit confusing and I still can't figure out how to change the XM radio stations from the steering wheel mounted controls. The climate controls themselves are a bit hard to reach - especially the dashboard mounted radio tuning knob if you like to sit farther back from the steering wheel. The car is pretty quiet and is a great cruiser - acceleration is adequate under normal conditions but the car does get up and go when you step on it- and it sounds great.

914, on 02/16/16 21:50 PM (PST),Dan ,2014 Lexus GS 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),F Sport Love," I recently purchased a 2014 CPO Lexus GS350 F Sport AWD. I wanted an AWD car that was supremely comfortable, reasonably quick, fair on gas, fun to drive and unique. The GS is all that and more. Having owned previous luxury marques such as Acura, Infiniti and a Lexus ES I didn't even bother cross shopping the Cadillac CTS, BMW 5 series, the Audi A6 or the Mercedes E350. Although fine automobiles in their own right my #1 criteria when shopping for any vehicle is reliability and low cost of ownership....and they fall short in that category. That is why I own a Toyota Tundra and not a Ford F150 or a Chevy Silverado, and also a Honda Civic and not a Ford Focus or Dodge Dart.The GS is undoubtedly the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. The 2014 has the toned down spindle grill (compared to the 2016 and other new Lexus'), a high quality interior, great handling and the most comfortable seats I have ever had in a car. The engine is quick to respond, the shifts are crisp without being jarring and the suspension offers great handling while providing a comfortable ride. The steering is fairly precise but a little on the heavy side. There is a sound enhancer under the hood that sends a sweet melody into the cabin when you nail the accelerator. Reminds me of a V8. The Lexus premium audio system is superb. It sounds as good or better than the Mark Levinson system that was in our ES and much better than Acura's ELS or Infiniti's Bose. The huge infotainment screen is top notch as are the gauge readouts. Some have complained about the mouse-like controller for all the functions  but after a few minutes of getting familiar I find it quite intuitive. Gas mileage is decent at around 27 hwy / 21 city. Our previous car was a 2014 Accord Touring Hybrid. Loved the 45mpg when gas was $4 a gallon but at today's prices 27mpg is not an issue.I do have a couple complaints with the car, although minor. The first is the road noise from the tires. I can't for the life of me figure out why Lexus builds such an outstanding car and then put on those sorry Bridgestone Turanza EL400s. The entire Potenza/Turanza line of tires are horrible. Doing a little research I have found that the cure for these noisy, hard riding tires are the PIRELLI CINTURATO P7 ALL SEASON PLUS tires. The reviews for these tires are off the charts for any sports sedan. Even better than the much lauded Michelins. I can't wait for these tires to wear out so I can order a set of the Pirellis. The other complaint I have is with the apparent thin paint. My car is Obsidian black and being a CPO Lexus they repaired all the stone chips before selling the car. At only 19,000 miles when I purchased it there are at least 8-10 small repairs on the hood. My Tundra is a silver 2010 with 70k miles and has maybe 3 chips. My '05 Civic has 4 or 5. I owned an Obsidian black Infiniti for 50k miles and it had maybe 3 or 4. I test drove and bought the Lexus on a rainy day so I didn't actually notice the chip repairs until it's first hand washing. Being somewhat OCD about my cars I was a little upset. I hope the repairs were the result of an over zealous paint technician trying to cover up every slight imperfection and not an indication that there is an ongoing problem with the paint. Only time will tell.Besides those 2 complaints I love this car. We are planning a 3 week tour of the western states and can't imagine a better vehicle to take on vacation and enjoy the driving experience at the same time.Other than those 2 minor complaints I am certain this car will provide years of satisfied driving.Update 8/16/2016Although I have only driven the car about 3,000 miles in the last 8 months we are leaving for Florida soon and will quickly add 2,500 miles. So far the car has been great. I have found that the comfortable 16 way driver's seat becomes a little uncomfortable after a couple hours of seat time. There are no lateral springs on the bottom cushion, just a layer of foam in a steel pan. I purchased a thin memory foam pad that I use on long trips. I was able to repair all stone chips with a razor blade to shave off all the high points. I then used a Porter Cable DA polisher to remove all the car wash scratches that came with the car. It is standing tall and I love driving it. I can't imagine a better road car than the Lexus GS 350. It's the perfect blend of luxury, comfort and performance. My one suggestion is not to buy new. Even though it's a Lexus the depreciation is pretty bad the first 2 years. Either buy a Certified pre owned or if you have to have new, lease.Update 2/17/17Still an awesome car with tremendous depreciation. MSRP in Aug. 2014: $59,850, CPO price when I bought in Dec. 2015, 19k miles: $39,900 +tax., today's trade value with 26,000 miles: $26-$29k. Daggone! I guess I should have waited and bought it @ 3 years old ...lol! Research by me has revealed that the GS depreciates more rapidly than all other Lexus models.Update 2/21/18 - Sold the car.",5.0,Lexus,GS 350,2017,gasoline,311.0,6,AUTOMATIC,RWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,28,20,454,50695,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,2017 Lexus GS 350 4dr Sedan RWD (6cyl)

With new tires, the car rides better - but still nothing like my 1999 GS.  I also feel Lexus's quality has slipped.  The car has been recalled no less than 4 times and, to this day, still has rattles in the dash and seat belt pillars.

The car delivered a respectable 25.6 mpg combined city and highway driving.  I found the NX300 front seats were exceptionally comfortable and the NX delivered an overall tranquil smooth ride; but, the NX interior falls short on being a practical SUV. Four adults going on a long trip are hard pressed due to the hemmed in cabin and cargo space.  Four standard 30” suit cases (the largest case airlines will check), will not fit in the back cargo space,“Upgrading” from a 2014 Toyota RAV4 Limited to a 2018 Lexus NX300 has been a disappointment. Both cars are built off the same platform, but the NX300 has less cabin room and cargo space. The Rear seating is tighter in the NX 300; especially, in the middle seat.  The NX is basically a four-seat car.  The Rear visibility and head room is less in the NX, and driver seat entering and exiting is a head banging experience.  The NX has a power seat easy access system (the driver seat automatically lowers and pulls back on ignition shut off), but it crushes the rear seat occupant.  Also, the center console is overly wide, giving the driver a hemmed in feeling.  This car is not for six-footers. Cabin road noise is about the same in both the RAV4 and NX thought the Lexus does have a slightly smoother ride and beefier engine.  Though the peppier engine comes at a hidden long-term cost: it uses premium gas (91 octane) which isn’t openly presented. Premium gas can cost an extra $.70 to $.90 cents per gallon in most areas.Most of the control buttons on the NX are an ergonomic mess. Some are below the steering wheel level that are hard to see; while others, on the dashboard center cluster sit directly in the sun light. The greenish yellow LED lights on/off positions cannot be differentiated on sunny days. The NX300 touch pad infotainment/ navigation system is a challenge to learn and use.  If you’re cell phone or computer “challenged”, this is not the car for you.   Be prepared to spend hours reading the owner manuals.  It’s interesting Toyota has moved Lexus to extremely computer-type controls that may appeal to the younger driver, who generally cannot afford a luxury car; and, has abandoned simplicity preferred by the older driver who can afford a luxury car.Be prepared to increase your monthly car payments, in the future, if you want to keep your “LEXUS EXPERIENCE”.  Besides the free trial subscription period for satellite radio there are three other free trail subscriptions for 1) remote start, 2) navigation system and 3) Wi-Fi (Verizon only).   The remote start feature works off a downloaded app on your smart cell phone. Each “advanced “ feature will cost $8.00 a month if kept.  This isn’t openly presented either. I feel The NX300 interior kills this car on being considered a luxury car.  The interior falls short on being engaging, innovative, unique, spacious or practical.  Four people cannot take this nice riding vehicle on a long ride trip, or even to the airport, because of the hemmed in cargo space the exterior design creates.SIT IN THE DIFFERENT SEATS FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE!

Accord had a very jerky transmission I had to fight with and an aggressive fuel savings (25-35 MPG on Accord vs 15-20 on RX) from which the gear switching and the ride comfort suffered. RX seems to have a much better sound system - at least it has the mids, comfortable and more adjustable seats - compared to the headrest tilting too much forward, and a large 12 inch entertainment screen (comes with NAV) - though it is not a touch screen and the controls are awkward and sluggish as compared to the touch screen and nearly perfect integration with smartphones as well as fast response time on the Accord. RX has a much larger and versatile storage / hauling capabilities, although the two are not in the same category. Looking further, the RX has a working Sport mode, where on the Accord the sport mode seems to ride two gears down from where it is supposed to be - driving at 4-5k RPM at 40-60mph makes one look like an idiot on the Accord. The Accord seems to have better dash and door materials and they are not as marr prone as on RX where after a week you can definatelly notice dust and smudges in places you touched them with your hands. No wonder my neighbors are washing and cleaning their RX every week. Paint seems much better and thicker on the RX where as on the new Accord models it is skin deep - after two years of driving on the highway, the front is littered with paint deeps and chips from tiny road dirt. One thing however that is not acceptable from Lexus is the requirement to pay to use the remote starter ($80-96/yr, even though it is already installed with push start) and the fact that once the vehicle is remotely started the vehicle shuts off as soon as you enter it - some safety nonsense. Accord also has a remote starter built in and it works at get go from the key fob; you can get into the car and press break+start to continue without the car ever shutting off - again this is the ideal implementation here and shame on Lexus for making us pay for a half baked nickel and dime solution. If you leave the remote inside Accord, the car won't let you lock and will beep at you, while the Lexus does none of that. Another thing to note is how loud the engine is on the RX from outside compared to the other new cars which are barely audible when new. There is also some loud knocking heard from the engine while parked as well as some whining when driving at 70 mph or higher and slightly holding the gas pedal - it generates noise similar to engine being revved up and let go (like it is running out of gas), all the while you are pressing the gas pedal consistently.

The steering is light and easy as opposed to the stiffer Audi steering.  I'm not sure why people think a stiff steering is better, but I have no problems doing twisty roads.

I have also owned and driven a Lexus LX 470 for 10 years and compared to that monstrous SUV this RX has been such a joy to drive plus the MPG is something that you can't even compare.  Ive been averaging around  22-24 mpg in this car compared to the LX I only got around 12-15 mpg.I got the black AWD 3.5 V6 edition and not the F sport.  The only real differences that I disliked in this model compared to the F sport is the plasticky spindle grill and the size of the tires 18 vs 20. I also have a regular size sunroof vs the panoramicOtherwise my two tone , cream and brown interior is gorgeous, I have the upgrade 13 in screen, heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, back up cameras, parking assist etc.My model was lacking the wireless phone charger which I'm bummed about and it didn't come with the Lexus self drive system which is a glorified lane assist system.  I managed to test that twice when I had a loaner car and the precision of the car for it to stay in the lane driving at 75mph or faster was quite impressive.  It was almost like I was driving a Tesla.Styling: Rating  9.8  I love the wide spindle grill in the front and the floating roof line.  It's very futuristic and quite a departure from the old school boring  RXs of the past.I was looking into getting the Audi Q5 and when I saw this car I was immediately in love and forgot about the Audi.RideRating 9.7Its buttery smooth and very pleasant.I do put the car in ECO mode 99% of the time so it does drive softer and slightly less under powered than when  I have it on Sport mode.MaterialsRating 9.3Very high quality plastics and leather.Its soft touch plastics everywhere except the corner where the left of the steering wheel is at. That FEELS HARD AND like a TOYOTA.The wood grain is exceptional and I wanted the light wood interior to go along with the light cream interior.AWDRating 9.8Our house is on a hill in wintry and snowy Massachusetts and so far this SUV has exceeded my expectation being able to scale up our steep driveway without any problems at all.NoiseRating 9.8I drive about 50 miles one way to the city and its a blessing for this car to insulate you from road noise and other noisy cars on the roadSound systemRating 6.8Maybe I should have upgraded to the Mark Levison sound system because even though the stock sound system is good, it's truly not exceptional for this class and price point.

The screen is huge and it splits and its gorgeous.The controls though are clumsy and very tedious to use especially when you’re driving and trying to click on something on the screen using that mouse stick.TERRIBLE.

This June we traded in a 2006 GX 470 for a 1 year old RX 350. While I never thought I would give up my big SUV, the year with the RX convinced me that I had to have one as well. This car is an incredible all around vehicle, and now I can say that it is a joy to own 2 of them! I could go on for a couple of pages on all the aspects of these cars that we love, but to some it up, comfort, handling, gas mileage, looks, and yes, I LOVE the electronics. This is the main reason I wanted to write this review. The entertainment system in this car gets a lot of hate around here.  So bad actually, that I was hesitant to even buy our first RX because of what was said. I will tell you that when you first start using it, the joystick seems out of control, and I can see why people complain. However, after reading up on the system and practicing on it while the vehicle was standing still, it is the coolest control center in an automobile I have ever used. The joystick and the display are so intuitive that I've gotten to the point where I don't even have to look at the screen to get done what I need to get done. Plus, the voice activation system (if you take the time to learn how to use it) is quite amazing. I have learned how perform the bulk of my tasks with my voice. It really doesn't get much better. So, if you go down and drive one of these things and get turned off by the controls on the entertainment system, fear not, soon you will be guiding the joystick like a pro and landing on SAT without even trying.",5.0,Lexus,NX 300h,2016,gasoline,194.0,4,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,30,33,454,41310,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,2016 Lexus NX 300h 4dr SUV AWD (4cyl)
938, on 10/30/16 17:45 PM (PDT),Neil ,2016 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),No longer trust Lexus," I bought RX350 2016 on Nov 2015, which is the first batch of that model onboard the US. I finally give this review because I cannot tolerate the car any longer due to the low quality. I purchased Lexus because I trust the most reliable vehicle brand, but the car I purchased makes me feel disappointed. I cannot imagine such a luxury expensive car has problems that should not deliver to market. Following points are the issues that annoy me a lot.1.	The floor of driver and passenger seats are not flat. The inner side of the floor is higher than the outer side. I never see the similar design on other cars. We feel very uncomfortable every time when I or the passenger put feet on the floor. Imagine you sit in a luxury car but one leg high one leg low.I reported this issue to the dealer. They said this is not a problem. All other RX350 2016 are same. I don’t agree with them. Even all cars of this model are same, it just indicates that the problem happens on all this model. There is no excuse for such bad experience on such level of the car.2.	The air conditioning system is noisy.The air conditioning system has obvious noise when it runs after 5 – 10 minutes. The noise sounds like somewhere of the car is leaking fluid. I reported this issue to the dealer. They acknowledged this problem and tried to fix it. They replaced the refrigerating fluid but the issue is still there. Finally, they said all other same model has this issue. It’s not my car’s problem. It’s the problem of the air conditioner, and the air conditioner is provided by a vendor of Lexus.3.	The MPG never reach the designed value.The car specification says the MPG of this car is “City 19/Hwy 26/Comb 22”. I drive the car 80% on highway. My highest MPG is 19.1. Is this a kind of false propaganda? Give a number that cannot be reached by customers.  I think this is same to the fake emissions incident happened on Volkswagen.4.	The passenger door needs heavier force to close.The passenger has to use heavier force to close the passenger door. The same force can close other doors but cannot close passenger door. I reported this issue to the dealer twice. The first time they acknowledged the issue, but engineer says they cannot fix it. The second time they just said cannot repro this issue. But 80% of the time my wife need to close the door twice, failed one time and use heavier force to close it again.5.	The car does not support Unicode characters.I am not a native English speaker, I often listen to songs with other languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean. I also have a lot of contacts that stored with Chinese names. The car shows all non-English characters as empty. It’s 2016, and it’s Lexus. I told this to a lot of people, they all cannot believe Lexus does not support a function that most other lower brand cars supported.Above problems annoy me every day every second when I use it. I trust Lexus so I decided to purchase it before I see the real car. Until now I still cannot believe this car is produced by Lexus. I also tried several months after I found these defects, I hope I can tolerate these issues after I used to them. Finally, I failed. I feel very unhappy with this car. It brings me a lot of pressure. Every day when I step on the slanted floor, when I hear the noise, when I ask my wife to close the door heavier, when I listen to songs, when I drive it, I feel frustrated and worriment. I think I cannot keep in this status any longer. It is very dangerous to drive with it. My wife also feel very scared when she hears the leaking voice. She feels the car will explode sooner or later.So, be careful when you are considering this car, even considering Lexus. They are not as reliable as they said.",1.0,Lexus,NX 300h,2016,gasoline,194.0,4,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,30,33,454,41310,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,2016 Lexus NX 300h 4dr SUV AWD (4cyl)

The 2016 RX 350 even without the F sport package has loud noises penetrating the cabin. The shifts between gears in the new 8 speed automatic are not smooth as expected from Lexus. The RX was always a comfortable car. That is what Lexus pioneered. Suddenly they are chasing the Germans with this mid life crisis and  anahialting a big chunk of there customer base. The build quality in certain areas is impeccable - though other manufacturers are catching up. When's the last time you sat in a Lincoln Black Label trim? The Lexus RX should focus on creating two destinct models. The F sport should be sporty while the regular spec 350 should be super luxurious. I have 4 friends who have the new RX and they ALL regret not extending the lease on the 2013/2015 model they had. They feel the older body style was superior on the comfort side.

It's cooling pipe went bust on the freeway, by the time we pulled to the next exit it over heated.  It ran another 6 months afterwards before we sold it to CarMax.  We bought the new '15 GX and it was totaled a month later after being rear ended by a careless driver.  The frame buckled and the rear bumper had the guys front end imprinted on it.  I was able to walk away with only a stiff neck.. the other driver had a fractured jaw, broken arm and leg and ribs.  The GX saved my live.  We bought our third GX a few weeks later.  This is a heavy traditional SUV, the acceleration is measured and ""stately"".  Fuel economy is in the high teens, not bad for this type of vehicle.  Handling is good if you get used to the truckiness.  On the freeway, it is stable and quiet.  It's not the quickest, but it does get to 80 to 90 mph before you know it.  The only complains I have is the poor placement of the two USB ports in the center console.  When plugged in, the sliding hatch cover have to be open.  And there are no power ports for the 2'nd row.  It got a little irritation having to charge the Kids' ipads on long trips.  The Lexus roof rack cross bars are nice looking, however, they sit too close to the roof making tying down cargo a bit difficult.  also you need a Torx key to move them.  I liked the old GX's roof rack, with plenty of tie in points to strap your cargo.Update, we got side swiped by some guy in a beat up 300.  We must be cursed in our GX!  The damage was extensive, from the front bumper to the back bumper.  The wife barely felt the impact, another testament to the safety of this truck.  Luckily only body damage sustained.  6 weeks and $13000 later, the truck was fixed with new bumper, fenders, doors, side step.  The only new gripe I have is the stock tires worn out faster than the tire warranty, and the ride is noticeably harsher than before.  We will be getting new meats for the truck soon.",5.0,Lexus,GX 460,2016,gasoline,301.0,8,AUTOMATIC,4WD,4,Midsize,SUV,20,15,454,50780,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2016 Lexus GX 460 4dr SUV 4WD (8cyl)

I have read so many comments at the bottom of reviews for the GX that rip it shreds and proclaim it nothing more than a mall crawler, trophy wife truck and an outdated one at that.  I will not disagree that in many instances those comments apply, but I applaud Toyota for offering a BOF SUV with a V8, I only wish I didn't have to buy a Lexus to get it.  This vehicle is for my wife, and yes she's my trophy and yes she does a fair amount of mall crawling, BUT....we also regularly tow a travel trailer and aren't afraid to traverse trails, cross small streams or other off road activities with bikes mounted on the roof, kids and dogs in the back.  We actually NEED capability and USE it! I am a long time Toyota fan, having owned multiple Tacomas and Lexus LS400's when I was in sales and I can't say enough good about their quality and longevity.  I sold my last LS400 with 267k on the odometer running strong!  With a travel trailer, two kids and a dog the '03 Tacoma double cab V6 wasn't cutting it for tow duties any longer and we test drove and fell in love with the 4Runner's looks and attitude.  What I didn't fall in love with was the 4.0L V6 and 4,700 lb tow rating.  With that bad news, my research led me to the ""Lexified"" version of the 4Runner, aka GX460.  From the moment we drove it, she loved the interior feel, looks(controversial) and smooth V8.  I liked the 6,500lb tow rating and the interior upgrades over the 4Runner.We looked at Tahoes/Yukons but didn't need that much size, looked at Jeep GC's but wanted a 3rd row and also looked at the Land Rover LR4. I absolutely loved the LR4 and was smitten with it's feel, looks, heritage and off road prowess.  She didn't care for it at all, and since we plan to keep this vehicle for a long time I figured it was much wiser to go with a Toyota rather than a Land Rover.I quickly realized that Toyota took a smart pill and figured out ""Why sell a V8 4Runner, when you can push consumers to the Lexus brand?"" We bought in hook, line and sinker.  It's a great truck, albeit heavy,thirsty, and expensive but if you want or need to tow and go off road your choices are pretty limited these days.  I'm confident it will serve us well for years to come.  If you don't have a need for ""duty"" get an RX or one of the other countless lifted sedans out there.11/23/16 UpdateWe have owned the vehicle for a year now and towed a 3,500lb camper over a thousand miles on two occasions.  The truck doesn't mind a bit and transports its occupants in style and comfort. A couple caveats:1) We have seen significantly better mileage using premium fuel, not sure why.2) It returns about 9-12 MPG when towing our camper3) It sags a bit more than I care for when towing, but we do not have the self-leveling suspension.4) The ""leather"" on the seats is sub-par for a $57,000 truck in my opinion.It is my understanding that this model is going away after 2017, so if you want/need a big body on frame SUV for towing in style with Toyota quality you'd better act quickly.",4.0,Lexus,GX 460,2016,gasoline,301.0,8,AUTOMATIC,4WD,4,Midsize,SUV,20,15,454,50780,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2016 Lexus GX 460 4dr SUV 4WD (8cyl)

The interior is very elegant and comfortable as you'd expect from a Lexus. Suspension is tuned to give a soft ride but tight enough for you to know its a sports car! Infotainment system is very easy to use in my opinion. The V6 engine is quiet and has ample horsepower to rival other cars in its class. One downside is the V6's fuel economy, which is so-so. Also the RC is a little heavy compared to others in the class. I usually get about 21mpg combined. I opted for the FSport package which included FSport exterior/interior styling and badges, adaptive variable transmission, 19in wheels w/ all-season Michelin tires, and a host of other features such as heated steering wheel and seats, back-up monitor with rear cross traffic alert, LFA inspired digital dash + more!

But all the things listed above is what made us go with this vehicle.  We were originally going to go with the new for 2014 Jeep Cherokee, but with all the problems owners were complaining about, especially with the new 9-speed transmission, I steered the wife away from it.  We really linked the appearance and feel of the Limited, but I've had more than my share of problem vehicles and it was clear from the 5 for, 43 against, owner reviews that we should avoid that SUV like the plague.  In the end, we feel in love with the Lincoln MKC and so far we have not regretted the purchase.  It's amazingly smooth riding and quiet -- it's even better than my 2006 Mercedes E500 -- and yet very peppy.  We wanted the 2.0L engine, but wound up with a loaded model which came with the 2.3L ecoboost.  Interestingly enough, however, on a recent trip home from Williamsburg, VA we found we were getting 28 mph rather than the advertised 26 mph for the AWD model.  What we really love about it is it's quite responsive and great on gas for a luxury SUV, but runs on regular, and I'm not talking 89, but 87 octane fuel.  The dealer told is it's designed to use the regular 87 octane and to not be afraid to do so.  Amazing and it uses considerably less fuel than my wife's previous vehicle, an Infinity G37 coupe, which ran on premium only.",5.0,Lincoln,MKC,2015,gasoline,240.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,SUV,29,20,61,46030,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2015 Lincoln MKC 4dr SUV FWD (4cyl)

Admittedly, the only reason I thought about this car was those silly commercials.  But still, I took a look and was surprised.  For the sticker price on the lot, you cannot compare this to some of the cars mentioned in Edmunds review.  I put $45k as a top on what I wanted to pay.  My local dealers did not have an MB GLK or Audi Q5 for less than $47k on the lot.  And the only BMW X3 I found under $50k didn't even have nav!  Really?   Yes, there was a Volvo XC60 or two that fit in my range.  But not as loaded as I was able to get my MKC.  I got the upgrade 2.3l engine, awd, the nav package, and several other options, including the incredible panoramic roof for $44k before any haggling or rebates.  I would say this model straddles segments as it more directly competed in price with the MB GLA class, BMW X1, Infiniti QX50, Audi Q3, and Volvo XC70, all of which I'd call tall wagons.  None had the ride height of the MKC.  The only vehicle I would say directly competes is the Acura RDX.  It did have more space and otherwise had similar features for the price, topping out at $44k.  But, honestly, the 3.5l V-6 in the Acura felt gutless compared to the 2.3l turbo 4 in the MKC.  That was probably my deciding factor.

1003, on 11/12/15 08:05 AM (PST),Laurie ,2013 Mazda 2 Hatchback Touring 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl 5M),An OK cheap car to get you from place to place," Ok first off I will state that this car does what I bought it to do. Go from place to place cheaply and helps me stay out of debt. Cheap was the main reason I bought it. I needed something new, reliable, from a respected manufacturer to get me from place to place. The Mazda 2 does this just fine. With that being said here is what I think of the car. I bought the automatic touring model. - Interior.         Cheap plastics that scratch easily. Cheap fabric that tears easily. My back seat tore with only 2000 miles on the car. No one uses my back seat except for occasionally my dog. We religiously put a blanket on the back seat whenever he was in the car to minimize dog hair all over it. Still the seat tore. Had it sewn professionally and it tore again along the seam. With that being said it is a good looking interior with black fabric and red piping to spruce it up a bit.         Hard to see fuel level indicator. Small gauges on the dash. The layout is fine but the gauges and text on the information system are small and hard to read.         Not a lot of room in it. My daughter has both a Mini Cooper Coupe and a Chevy Sonic. Both small cars, like the Mazda 2, but both have tons more room inside. I feel like I am sitting on top of my passenger in the Mazda 2. In order to fit in the car I have to have the seat all the way back, the seat bottom lowered as far as it will go and the seat back reclining far back. In this position I am forced to keep my nose up high to see over the dash. And I am not especially tall (5'7""), but I do get my height from my legs. When I am in the driver's seat there is no leg room at all for any passengers behind me.         Cup holders are hidden underneath the optional arm rest I had installed. No back seat cup holders. Little storage.        We got the 6 speaker Bose system. Its an ok system. I have heard a lot better.        The windows wont defog for the life of me. I have tried every setting on the heat/ac system and the only setting that works in a/c on (even in winter in new england brrr) and full blast fan coming out of the defrost setting only. I had some luck with Rain Dance defogger.  - Exterior.       The chrome peeled off the Mazda 2 logo in back within weeks of buying the car. Other than that the exterior has held up pretty well.  - Mechanics.       It has been a reliable running vehicle now for 2+ years and 50,000 miles on it. It always starts in cold new england winters. Maintenance has been cheap and in frequent. Balise Mazda in West Springfield, Ma has been awesome! Now the bad. The brakes! Ugh. The anti lock brake feature comes on way too early. I have had  multiple issues stopping in it. I found pumping helps. I brought this up to Mazda service and they cant find anything wrong with them. Today I nearly hit a Jeep in front of me and it wasnt even in hard braking conditions. The anti lock braking comes on at random times. This is not acceptable and is the main reason I am trading the car in. I need braking power. Too many hills and bad road conditions in western Massachusetts to play around with finicky brakes.  - Handling.       It is easy to drive and handles fine. I taught my teenaged daughter to drive in it. It is way underpowered for driving in a hilly or mountainous region. I have given up on certain freeway on ramps because the car just doesnt have enough power to get up to 65 and merge. Now on to winter driving. Get 4 really good snow tires if you have to drive on snow at all. I had NO control on snow with the stock tires. I have a little better with top of the line snow tires but its still not really good and leaves me driving with sweat covered hands due to nerves.  - Overall.      If you are looking for something cheap, with fair MPG, and from a reliable maker then the Mazda 2 is a good bet. If you live in a hilly or mountainous area with bad weather then look at something with better handling, heating, power and control.",2.0,Mazda,2,2013,gasoline,100.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Compact,Hatchback,34,28,586,17050,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,2013 Mazda 2 4dr Hatchback FWD (4cyl)

This is a great car for a DIYer, because the maintenance is easy to perform. It handles quite well, with almost a car-like feeling. Performance is decent as well, it can easily tow small boats and trailers with no problem. It does lack a little power when you seat 5 and haul luggage and a trailer, but this has to be expected for a 200hp and sub-200 ft/lbs vehicle. A downside of the car is that fuel economy isn't very good.  Traction in the snow is amazing, the 4wd does its job very well. I have never been stuck anywhere, even in the worst Quebec snowstorms with 50cm of snow (of course,  good winter tires and the high ground clearance also help). It has plenty of cargo space and the interior is roomy. The sound system is decent but I wish it at least had an auxiliary input. Just do your regular maintenance and replace aging parts before they fail, and this car will amaze you with its reliability.  Mine is going on 10 years and I feel almost no signs of aging (keep in mind that I have taken great preventive care of it, religiously changed all fluids, etc.).

Seemed ok during the short test ride, but after owning the car and riding for longer distances, we found the passenger seat to be very uncomfortable.   Also, the headrests were tilted too far forward and caused neck aches.  We talked to the dealership about these issues, but they offered no solutions.  I had to remove the passenger seat from the vehicle, unhook the leather upholstery, and cut away some of the seat foam from both sides of the seat cushion.  Had to repeat this procedure a second time to achieve the desired comfort.  Clamped the headrests in my bench vice and bent each support rod until they fit right.  Now the car is comfortable, but one shouldn't have to go through all of that.  Also had to adjust the headlights up to see adequately on dims.  The owners manual gave no instructions to do this - thank goodness for google.  Just a few other minor gripes:  Mazda should have included a water temperature gauge.  An ammeter would be good too.  The GPS navigation system is NOT user friendly and the voice control is an exercise in frustration.  The Bose sound system is not as good as the stock radio in my Honda Accord.

I'll touch on a few of the pros and cons of the vehicle itself, but the most impressive feature of this car was the keys.  I rented the Mazda 3 during a recent visit to the Big Island of Hawaii.  Over twelve days I drove all over the island and got to know the car pretty well.  It's a very nice vehicle.  Sleek looking, comfortable, handles well and gets excellent gas mileage.  I had never used a back-up camera before and now I'm sold on the things thanks to the Mazda 3.  The traction and handling in rain and dirt roads was excellent and the vehicle was basically fun to drive.  This particular car didn't have navigation, so I can't report on that.  The only thing I didn't really care about was the sound/""entertainment"" system, which wasn't very intuitive and was kind of a hassle to navigate.  It took me a couple of days of fiddling around with it to get it dialed-in.  Once I did, the sound quality with the radio and an iPod was quite good.  All in all it's a sporty, fun and comfortable car to drive.....  I was in Hawaii mainly to do some scuba diving and this is where the keys come in.  On one particular dive I went down to 99 feet and spent 50 minutes at or below 42 feet.  It was a great dive and I got back on the boat wanting more.  As I pulled off my wetsuit, I was shocked to discover that I had left the car keys (Fob) in the shorts that I wore under the wetsuit :(   I immediately realized that the keys had been down to 99 feet (significant water pressure down there) and that they were probably toast after the deep dive.  They even felt a little heavier, and I was already thinking of how I would have to contact the rental company, explain my screw-up, and (hopefully) still be eligible to rent another car from them.  Even the Dive Masters were ribbing me a bit over what I had done.  At the end of the day I fatalistically approached the car and tried opening the trunk using the keyless Fob.  It worked.  At least now I could put my gear in the trunk.  Next I tried unlocking the doors and that worked too!  By then I knew I was golden; astonished and relieved since the car has a keyless ignition.  The keys continued to work flawlessly for the next eight days.  So, I can't really say much more about the car, but if it's built like the keyless Fob I'm totally sold on the 2017 Mazda 3.",5.0,Mazda,3,2017,gasoline,155.0,4,AUTOMATIC,FWD,4,Midsize,Sedan,37,28,586,21495,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2017 Mazda 3 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

Despite recommendations from friends and family to avoid a decade old German vehicle, I was drawn to the style and the way it felt when I test drove it.  While certainly far from the most rare or exotic Mercedes-Benz, the car still offered a certain pizzazz the car I was driving (a fox-body Mustang) just didn't have. Mechanically, the car has been as sound as any 16 year old car can be. The headliner needed to be replaced a year or so after purchase, as did a crank position sensor and the hoods struts. Earlier this year, the driver's seat position motor also needed replaced. Otherwise, I dare say the car has been almost bulletproof. I'm not proud to say I've driven the car in exceedingly adverse conditions, including heavy flooding and sleet when I had no business being on the road. Each time the car delivered me to my destination safely. I've driven it from my home in Texas to California, Georgia and even Baja California in Mexico. Its been my commuter, grocery getter, and I've taken it to the home repair store for lumber or insulation more times than you'd think. Really, my only gripe is that I wish they spend the same attention to style, detail and build quality on the interior as they obviously did the rest of the vehicle. The grey on grey interior in my car is sort of bland, and my car came with a tape player only. When buying a Mercedes, you'd think they wouldn't nickle and dime you for a CD player. The seats are also a little firm, but most people probably won't notice because they won't drive it 11 or 12 hours at a time the way I have driven mine.

1158, on 01/26/16 09:38 AM (PST),anonymous ,2014 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),6 months with the 2014 B-Class," Leased the 2014 B-Class in June of 2015 for $260/mo including the 3 yr maint. Fit and finish is very good, on par with MB standard. Car feels solid and the style makes it blends in with most other vehicles on the road. Descent acceleration at stop lights. I got the multimedia and extended range pkg. The command center is nice, however, even a Hyundai can put a touch screen in their vehicle, and this MB cost twice as much and yet only has a fixed display the show limited info. Ventilation is poor for the back seats. If I have all the vents open in the front, there is very little air flow to the back. On damp days, if I do not have the A/C on, the windshield fogs up very quickly. Heating and cooling control was tucked way down in the center console, you have to take your eyes off the road and search for the button to make changes -- poor design. The 1-finger seat fold down design is a welcome improvement. So are the blind spot and 'too close' braking warning. The 'drift off lane' warning needs a program rewrite as it often gave false alerts when I make turns. The most important point of an EV - range. EPA and MB rated this car at 87 miles. I can only get 62-summer and 55-winter out of it. (Yes, warning for hot summer days (using A/C) and cold winter days (using heater), your mileage WILL vary!). This works OK during the week as I only have a 25 mile round trip commute. However, this limits/eliminates the usage for this vehicle for weekend trips (as EV charger are few and far in between in the tri state area). At lease for me, it is uncommon to travel over 30 miles 1-way to visit a friend/relative or my favorite bar/restaurant. The 60 mile range just doesn't cut it. I try the 110v/12A charger that came with the vehicle when I first got the vehicle - added 20 miles over a 24hr period. and the salesman assures me that I can charge the vehicle within 8 hrs with this level 1 charger, go figure! With a Clipper Creek HC40, this car needs 3.5 hrs to charge to 100%.The ride is very comfortable and very quiet. Entertainment system is OK considering the price of the car. Cost per mile is much better than my SUV but just a tag under the 30 mpg Corolla. So the savings will depend on which vehicle are you replacing.Range charge time, and available charging stations remains to be the weak points for these EVs (at lease at the time this review was written Jan2016).At end of lease (Jun 2018)Overall, the car is pretty good. Range remains to be the short fall of this EV. In summer time, I can get 80+ miles over 1 charge, but at cold winter days, I can only get approx 55 miles out of 1 charge. This means I have to have a gasoline car as back up for longer distance trips. Cooling remain to be poor for the back seats. I have to turn off some of the vents in front to force the cool air to the back seat vents. Car come with ride-flat tires and cost more to repair for punctures. At the end of lease, I have only 28,000 miles and Mercedes said the tires are already worn out of minimum thread depth (1/4"") and I need to replace them prior to return. Mercedes also required a yearly maint. for lease vehicles and the cost of that for a EV is $1,000 each year, Pricy.  Not sure if it is the tire or the car, but this combination perform poorly on snow.Front seat is comfortable. Rear seat (I don't have a lot of chance to seat at the back) is good, according to the opinions of my passengers. Front seat AC is very good, back is poor. Cargo room is small but the rear seats do fold down, that gives some decent room to carry medium stuff. Acceleration is good. Tire traction is poor. Flooring the accelerator cause front tire to slip a little even on dry roads. Both interior and exterior fit and finish is good. Seat cushions are nice and firm.All in all, I like EVs. Don't have to scout for low gasoline  prices, don't have to worry about radiator or engine Oil, zero emission. The Merceds B-class is comfortable and nice. Range and price is the short fall for this car. I would definitely buy or lease another EV, just with want to wait for the next gen where they have longer range and lower prices.",4.0,Mercedes-Benz,B-Class Electric Drive,2015,electric,177.0,0,DIRECT_DRIVE,FWD,4,Compact,Hatchback,82,85,617,41450,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,2015 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive 4dr Hatchback FWD (0cyl)

All of which it does well. I don't know what the reviewers are talking about when they criticize this cars performance. It does well doing what it was designed to do. It is inexpensive, utilitarian, reliable transportation. Think a modern version of the original VW bug. Its inexpensive, fun, quirky, and doesn't resemble everything else on the road. Being said, the car is also fun to drive. I think it goes without saying that this car will not give you the driving experience of launching you back in your seat when you hit the gas. It does give you the type of fun driving experience that is associated with driving a lightweight car that you can whip around corners, and in my opinion the car has a very nice exhaust note while doing so. Many of the professional car reviewers over dramatize this cars ability on the highway. It has adequate acceleration, and does fine at higher speeds.

Unbelievable!  Huge sale brought me into the fold and the car doesn't disappoint.  The car is packed with standard feature and Is easy to drive.  Professional reviewers mention how the handling and performance are sub par but in reality the car is fine on the road.  Sure it could be tuned to be tighter but it is fine.  Maybe the '17 model will include a USA tuned suspension.  Acceleration with the 5 speed is fine and the car is totally geared towards fuel efficiency.  On the first tank of gas the car pegged 46.3 miles per gallon in mixed driving.  I find the car super easy to drive and it's very comfortable on the inside.  The dash design is good and materials are par for the class.  The seats and auto climate controls are far above class average.  If your going to drive a small car you hope to get above 40 mpg.  In the Mirage you actually get that high mpg at a low price in a good package.  The car is a great value and I'm glad I waited to get one.  I almost bought one in the fall for around $11,500 but I waited and lucked out.  Now that I own one I would say anywhere between 9500 and 11500 would be a fair price for the Mirage.  On the upper end ES model prices can get up there pretty high and I would question the value of those models seeing that they have all the same mechanics as the DE model.

I traded in my Ford Focus ST for two of them, one for me and one for the wife. Let be honest in saying I couldn't be happier with my car. When I first drove it I thought ok it's fun to drive but it's just ok, the price point is right and my wife and I need a gas efficient inexpensive car so we made the purchase going these are ok; however three days later I realized that this little car is amazing, it doesn't pretend to be something it's not, it's not a 6 cylinder mustang with a shouty exhaust pretending it's a v8 race car. It has room enough for four people comfortably and five in a pinch when four buddy's and I make a lunch run. It has 2 ways to connect my iPod for tunes and a CD player for good measure. As far as the masses of people who say this vivacious little go cart is under powered, I have to disagree; I have the 1.2L standard transmission and have had zero problems accelerating off a stop light or getting up to highway speeds. That being said I have not driven the cvt model and can't attest to how it drives. The trim is adequate for the price and the controls are exactly where I feel they should be. The seats are very comfortable and the only thing I could ask for is an arm rest (I seriously want one). I have not treated my mirage like a weak little city car I fold down the seats and put several hundred pounds of tile in it for home improvements; I've taken it up logging roads unpacked, unpaved, and very up hill. This car has very much changed my view of vehicles and practicality, I don't miss my Focus, in my opinion the Mirage is more fun to drive it handles like a go cart you can do a u turn on a two lane road with out going off on the shoulder, you can park it literally anywhere, and finally they under sell the gas mileage I usually see 42mpg city and about 46mpg highway, my highway driving in Washington state is normally at 70mph. All in all this is my favorite vehicle that I have owed and the only changes I plan to make are adding fog lights and a roof rack.***Update***It's now been two years since my first entry to this review; my car now has 27000 miles and my wife's car has 64000.

1257, on 02/19/18 14:49 PM (PST),Jake ,2018 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Best Value," Bought a 2018 Mirage 5speed in November of 2017 for $9988 plus tax/license. After 13,000 miles I consider it the best small car on the road for these reasons:  The 3 cylinder engine has been around for decades and is both refined and powerful for its size. The car easily keeps up with traffic and holds 65mphon the highway with two adults at 3400 rpm, which is about half throttle. Engine red line is 6,500rpm. The interior is spacious and comfortable and the ride is surprisingly smooth. Handling is nimble and secure at legal speeds and interior noise is low to moderate. The car has bluetooth/USB and touchscreen controls, although I mostly use the manual controls and just listen to the radio using the steering wheel mounted buttons. It has power locks/windows and numerous airbags, and even a backup camera, which seems a little unnecessary to me.  Using the heater all winter( which runs the compressor and lowers mileage) I have averaged 45plus mpg in general driving and 48-50mpg highway. On warmer days when no heat was needed the mileage went up so that one tankful averaged 49mpg. This is phenomenal for a non hybrid car. My wife had a 2012 Prius C and the Mirage has a similar 'feel' and fuel efficiency for $10,000 less. My only complaints-and these are minor-is that the manual transmission is a little 'notchy' at first and requires some practice and break-in to shift smoothly. (The gear ratios, however, are Perfectly spaced for the engine and allow the car to cruise most roads at under 3,000rpm. The  little engine is NOT straining as one would expect, rather has a smooth, torquey power band.) The only other minor flaw is that the windows tend to fog up a little in winter unless the fan is on. This will not be a problem in summer.  This car has a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty and 7 years rust through protection with a 5 year roadside assistance. It is solid all around transportation that is fun to drive-not in a Mazda Miata way- rather in a perky small car easy to drive way.My advice is to IGNORE the 'experts' and test drive this car! For the price of a used car like a Honda Fit you will have a great little car with a fantastic warranty.UPDATE: September 2018..after 13,600 miles the car has been totally trouble free and the shifting has smoothed so that I easily go between gears. The air conditioning draws some power from the engine and is not the most powerful air I have ever used, buts works well enough. NOT a big deal. I honestly like the car more and more and would recommend this vehicle to anyone. It is not the smoothest, fastest, quietest, biggest, best handing car on the road but it is NOT supposed to be- Remember that it costs less than $10,000 new and it does EVERYTHING well For basic all around driving...

1273, on 07/02/17 13:51 PM (PDT),Rob ,2016 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great Car- Easily Overlooked," Lets be real about this review.  This is a compact AWD car for around $20k.  This is an all-around excellent, fun to drive car.  For what you pay and what you get there is no equal. This car is easily overlooked in favor of other small foreign cars and this includes the Subaru.  So far no mechanical issues  (40,000 miles).  I have a 2016 ES, AWD with the 2.4 CVT.  I love that the technology in the car (or lack of). It's simple and in some ways , ""old school"".  Controls are laid out well and easy to use.  Visibility is excellent!!  I am a smaller person and never have an issue checking my blind spots or backing the car.  The 2.4 engine delivers very nice power especially at highway speeds.  I personally find the fuel-economy to be very good.  If you put things into perspective and consider the following;  2.4, CVT (automatic) with A/C and AWD. Then I think 30 MPG is outstanding!! I don't know why other reviews on this car suggest fuel-economy is sub-par.  I find it, in fact, to be rather good.  I don't care for the CVT automatic.  I think it holds the engine performance back too much and it never allows the engine to happily-rev to the red line, instead it allows for a leisurely stroll around the tach.  Also, the engine tends to operate in the same range of about 1500-2500 rpm for almost every driving condition.  I find myself forcing higher rpm from the engine, just to get it out of that operating range.  By the time I can get to the extra power it's no longer needed.  So I find this to be pretty disappointing.  For lack of better wording, I also find the engine trying to ""lug"" from time to time, especially if climbing a grade after starting from a stop.  This is among the worst CVT transmissions I have ever used.  It is far from smooth and VERY slow to respond to throttle changes.  Mine does tend to ""jerk"" from time to time, and has no problems letting you know it's unrefined.  For the AWD system:  I have yet to encounter any serious snow conditions. Most of the time it's the usual 2-3"" of snow/slush on most main roads and a few secondary roads and the AWD system is flawless.  However, I did have the opportunity to drive the car in approx 6"" of snow on secondary roads during the past winter.  The car performed well but there is room for improvement.  I did notice a bit of wheel spin from the rear wheels under the worst conditions.  This is more than I would like for an AWD car.  it slips and spins in deeper snow but it did not get stuck and seems capable.  I'm not sure I would take this car off road either.  Also to note -my car came with ridiculous ""traction B"" tires that I quickly replaced to a more appropriate tire for my area.  (be VERY careful in the rain with these OE tires).  Overall, I'm very pleased with my car. I purchased mine brand new and so far no serious problems.

1280, on 07/30/18 12:30 PM (PDT),Katie ,2017 Nissan Rogue SUV SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Nissan's best selling SUV is my nightmare," I have owned my 2017 Nissan Rogue SV for just over a year now and have put over 17,000 on the car. For the first 15,000 miles the car was great and never had any issues. Once the car hit 16,000 is when the problems started happening. Lets talk about the good stuff: the car's hide and dived trunk feature is absolutely amazing. Being a mom to a toddler, I can put the stroller on the bottom shelf and still have room for items on the bottom and top self. The rear seats are raised so they sit higher than the front; this is a nice feature if you ever have to sit in the back. But I find it can be a little difficult loading my young child into their car seat because I have to step up higher to access it. (I am sure this is not an issue if you're tall) Due to this being the SV model my car only has the power adjustable driver seat. I have lower back problems so being able to raise this seat and have lumbar support is very nice. The passenger seat is comfortable but during our long road tips in the Rogue, I have found that the driver seat is a better place to be. The car gets excellent gas mileage for being a small SUV. I average about 415 miles per tank and when we go on long road trips, I have seen it up to 480 miles on one tank of gas. (This is without Eco mod on and I can have a lead foot. ) The standard Cross traffic alert and blind spot monitoring are a huge bonus (Especially because this car has terribly large blind spots). Now it is time for the bad: The back up camera on the 2017 (with out the nav) is a joke. The screen is small and the quality of the camera is fair at best. It does get the job done, but I don't rely on it when I am backing up. The road noise on the car is terrible, if I am calling anyone over Bluetooth I have to turn the volume all the up to be able to hear them and most of the time the other person can hear the road. The tan cloth seats are horrible quality; they got stained in 1 week after owning the car and made the car look 10 years old. Nissan's response to that was ""put seat covers over them."" The car is grossly under powered. Merging onto the highway is a little scary and if you have to pass someone, you better make sure you have time because the CVT doesn't want to get the engine moving.  The problems: At 16,000 miles I noticed my Rogue jerking a lot more when I would try to accelerate from stop and go traffic. A slight tap on the pedal would cause the RPMs to jump up to 6 then drop to 0. I took it to the dealership and was told that they couldn't replicate the issue. So in order for me to prove that this was happening, I had to film the issue. Once I got it on film I took the car back at 16,700. (yes it took that long for the issue to happen again). The dealership kept the car for a few hours then called me to say ""it's done"". According to the Carfax report and the dealers paperwork they ""serviced the transmission."" Well at 17,000 the car started to do the same thing and at different times. I took it back and was told the same thing ""we need it on film"". The car currently has 17,800 miles on it and I drive around with a GoPro attached to the cluster gage so I can get the issue on film AGAIN! I took the car to a trusted mechanic to get a second opinion. I was told that the transmission is slipping and probably has a year at best of life left in it. Taking this over to Nissan, they are refusing to look at the car until I can get the issue on film again. Due to it being my only car, I now have to drive around with this potentially dangerous machine until it decides to act up again and have Nissan fix it.

1281, on 08/26/17 14:09 PM (PDT),DW ,2017 Nissan Rogue SUV SV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl CVT),Buyer beware," I like many took the vehicle (2017 Nissan Rouge SV cloth interior with drive side powered seat) out for a short test drive and I liked how it drove. At the time of this review (Note:I bought my vehicle on 5/18/2017 and today is 8/26/2017).  The vehicle front drivers seat ( Cloth Material power) is now putting pressure on the back of my legs causing quite of bit of discomfort/pain ( that is putting it nicely). I have tried adjusting the seat several times, In every different position it will allow me to. I have had no success in releaving my discomfort. It was suggested that I place a pillow behind me to move me forward in the seat. Yes that took the presure point off that part of my legs and now placed unto another part of my legs. Now I have taken drastic measure, I have purchased a memory foam car pillow and placed under my butt/legs in order to lift my legs away from the front of the driver seat, that is where it seems the culprit of my problem is. At the end of the seat it has a slight up swing and the foam padding has no give to it. That is what's is causing the seat to dig into the back of my legs causing me pain. I have contacted Nissan and I also went back to where I purchased it. The service dept. looked me straight in my face and said didn't you take it for a test ride before you bought. I replied yes then they said did you feel any problem on your test drive I replayed no. Their answer to me was that is how the seat is made and there isn't a thing they can do for me. I called Nissan's customer service in Tenn. The nicely spoken female on the other end of the line was from Nisan consumer reports in Tenn. She stated to me that she is not a technician and has to go on what the Mechanics at the dealership recommends. She also stated that they take all consumers reports and pass them onto the appropriate team so they can possibly improve on the vehicle. What baffles my imagination is that no one from the dealership did any research. Like take my vehicle out for a test ride to see maybe I had a defective seat or to even go look at another cars seat to compare the two. It was an immediate that is how the seat is made and there is nothing we can do. One person at the service dept. recommended I might want to find a custom reholpster maybe they can help me with my problem, but they had no one to recommend. I did my research on the reholpster and found one willing to try to help me relieve the pressure point in the seat. I was in so much discomfort that I was willing to try anything to release it. I did and it has relieve some of the problem I was having. Now at least I can drive the vehicle. So the out come of this is Basically I should have caught the problem at the test drive now I am S.O.L. I was on my own to find a solution to it. So now after my little rant I would have to say No the front Driver Seat of my 2017  Rogue is not comfortable. I have done a little more research regarding this vehicle. Their leather interior driver powered seat seems to have an added adjustment. It looks like it has a foward and backward tilt. If the cloth seat had that feature it would most likely corrected my problem. But if you buy or want leather you have to deal with all the other Bells and whistles ( which I did not want ) they shove down the consumer throat and it is not cheap. Those sticker prices of those vehicles ranged some where in the low to upper 30k. Good luck with your purchase hopefully you will have a better experience then I did singed A Unhappy Consumer. I finaly brought the car into a custom reholpster they took out the stiffness in the front of the seat replaced it with memory foam. That was a costly fix for me. After I did that I finaly got a call from the mgr of my local Nissan. he was sympathic to my problem and wanted to know what could be done for me, I explained what I did and how muc it cost me. The Mgr payed half the cost of the possible fix to my problem. I drove the car for a few days and still after all that I still felt uncomfortable. I finaly tried several memory foam pillows to sit on. I have now choosen one of them and have been sitting on it ever since. ( My friends wfe makes fun of my cushion she calls it my booster seat) It is now toerable to drive but still uncomfortable.  If I could I would trade the car in to car max and purchase a different vehicle from a different manufacture but it is not in my budgetting at the moment. Hate to say it but this was my First  purchase of a Nissan Vehicle and probably is my last time buying a Nissan too..  Today’s date is Sept. 6  2018 Nothing has changed since my last posting on here.

1284, on 08/10/18 16:10 PM (PDT),Diane ,2016 Nissan Juke Hatchback S 4dr Hatchback AWD (1.6L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Cute car but CVT TERRIBLE," I had heard that the Nissan Juke was known for its significantly problematic continuously variable transmission (CVT).  I really loved the shape and turbo performance of the vehicle, so I bought it and put thousands of saved money towards the purchase.  Once the car hit 34,000 miles, the transmission went and had to be replaced.  The dealership basically indicated that I was being overly concerned since ""it's covered under warranty"".  Firstly, I like to travel and don't appreciate getting stuck with a broken down car with no working transmission.  Secondly, it is great that it's covered under warrantly; however, when I purchase a vehicle, I plan on having it past the 100,000 mile warranty.  I've purchased many vehicles in my lifetime and drove them far beyond 100,000 miles.  As soon as they replaced the transmission, I traded it in at a different dealership and I made sure that my second new vehicle does NOT have a CVT!  They are cheap transmissions.

1292, on 02/20/18 18:31 PM (PST),Scott ,2017 Nissan Pathfinder SUV SV 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Cross Country Tow & Mountain Tour Test Scored A+," I've had this vehicle now for 15 months and I have grown to enjoy it more and more as time passes.  The latest test was a 4000 mile RT on I-80 towing a loaded 5' X 8' U-Haul trailer in February and a mountain tour in the Rockies.  The car did everything well.  Mileage on the road is excellent for a 4600 lb. vehicle.  It cruises well and the engine is responsive at all speeds, likely because of the continuously variable transmission.  The CVT took a while to get used to, it is the first one I have owned but with a strong 3.5 liter V6 engine there really are no drawbacks and the associated fuel economy is a bonus.  The car tracks straight on the highway and was virtually unfazed by 40 - 60 mph cross winds even towing the trailer; very stable.  And the automatic 4WD coupled is a very secure experience driving over icy patches in a stiff crosswind on the high elevation interstate in SE Wyoming.  In light slick snow the traction is very secure; you can see the rear wheels kick in when cornering and not have to worry about fishtailing.  Ride is good but not cushy comfortable; there is a firmness to it and you can feel the bumps.  The OEM Michelin Latitude tires soften impacts however and they have great traction in wet and snowy conditions.  In the mountains I was extremely pleased with the suspension, handling, and steering; no body roll and a firm grip on the road.  The CVT was also very satisfying descending steep grades; all you have to do is push a button on the shifter to take it out of overdrive and let the engine do the braking.  The SV model comes with cloth seats which were very comfortable on the 8-10 hour drive days.  NIssan could do better with the quality of the cloth but the surfaces were soft touch and we didn't want to pay for leather in the SL trim.  We have been extremely happy with the cold weather package (front seat heaters and heated steering wheel) - I was shocked that I could buy a heated steering wheel for such a reasonable cost on a lower trim level (although packed with value options).  We were attracted to this model first by the spacious middle seat and large doors.  The seat is wide to seat three medium sized adults, sits up a bit higher than the front seats and has outstanding legroom like most of the cars from the 50's and early 60's had.  The third seat is really for kids or petite adults but when folded down provides a large cargo area which we used on our two week trip.  When the third seat is set up my wife likes the size of the reduced cargo area when stowing groceries but some may think it is too small.  This model was freshened for 2017 and Nissan seemed to do a good job correcting all the model's driving weaknesses that I have read about.  I looked at the 2018's and discovered that there are hardly any changes so all my comments should apply to the current model year.  We plan on keeping this vehicle at least seven years as we enjoy driving it, the car is very functional for what an SUV should do, and the first two seat rows are so roomy and comfortable.  I wasn't sure I would like it this much when I purchased it.",5.0,Nissan,Frontier,2017,gasoline,261.0,6,AUTOMATIC,RWD,4,Compact,Pickup,23,16,2009,25750,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2017 Nissan Frontier 4dr Pickup RWD (6cyl)

It was shaky when idling, hesitant with acceleration, and one time when i started it up, it shook pretty bad, and then shut off.  I took it to the dealership hoping it might be an issue my warranty would cover, but it did not.  I had to pay $500 to have the mass airflow sensor replaced and the broken engine air filter bracket replaced.   I was upset about this, as I feel  something like that should not go wrong on a new-ish car with such low mileage.  I also read online elsewhere that some folks have had issues with the transmission at around 60K miles or less, and they have had to replace the transmission.  That really worries me, so i'm thinking of trading this car in for something more reliable.

Did not want a CVT so the base model was only available.  Basic operation no issues.  Braking, accel, paint, tires, oil consumption (none), Radio, Dash indicators, visibility, fuel consumption 33-40, manual trans 5 spd, long trips great, steering, traction great in rain, cross wind in Tx good, internal room for 5, internal room for stuff surprising for a little car.Purpose of this car was for long trips (18000mi) thus 72K mi in 4 years.  Main expense is oil and oil filters every 5K miles.  Did have to replace 1 rear wheel bearing @65K miles. Tires replaced at 65K miles, should have replaced @60K.  I use synthetic oil and Nissan oil filters.  Car power is good enough and can get to 80+ ramping on freeway in Tx.  Would like a 6 speed but 5 works.  Need to rev to 5k rpm to get full power.  Has coolant Temp indicator that I require.  Few cars I checked still had a temp gauge.  This car has seats that beat any other cars I have driven on long trips.  Secret is the lumbar support, there is no adjustment,  just the best seats for long trips.  Can pack a lot in the back.  Great leg room in back and can seat 3 adults in back.  Baby seat attachment points for 3 seats in rear.  Storage with back seat up is good for trip.I wishIt had auto door locks, cruise,  14 gal gas tank, and arm rests both front seats. Average Mileage indicator over states and sometimes under states actual average mileage.  The gas pedal is not positioned well for long distance but I can position my foot so it is fine.  Cruise would take care of this.Driving experience has been great in town or on highway.  In Tx, speed limits up to 85 no issue.  Rpm is about 4200 at 85 and mileage drops to 30 or so but power is not an issue and tracks as well as any car I drive.  One of my first trips was to Chicago and hit extreme rain storm on highway.  We were 1 of the few cars driving with high winds, dumping rain, and hail.  No problems.  I was extremely surprised at the traction and stability, the traction control did not activate but it does work when needed, just rock solid steering and traction.  Continental tires may be the reason.  Around town is great with small turning radius, visibility, fuel 36+, and great AC.Mileage ranges 30 -40+.  Speed and hills make a difference.  Flat: 80 = 30-32, 75 = 33, 70 = 34, 65 = 35-36, 45 = 40  At times on flat road at 45 I got 40+  When I take it easy at 65 flat roads I get 36-38 mpg.I did not want CVT nor too much technology so decided on this car.  It has hand crank windows but does have power outside mirrors.  I have to remember to lock the rear hatch and would be nice if it was power lock.  Glove box is good.  Drink holders are functional but could be better especially holder in door.  Would like a better spot for 2 cell phones.  I use an inverter for 120V computer or cell phone power and works fine using 12V power port.  At night, cannot see key ignition location with door closed.72k+ milesThis is a 'simple' car with AC that covers Tx. 105+ days, gets good gas mileage, long distance driving comfort, plenty rear leg and head room (6' 2), plenty of space for luggage or groceries, one maintenance issue rear bearing cost $100 and I replaced it, uses no oil, paint looks good, good traction, and tracks well in cross winds.

1314, on 08/19/16 21:46 PM (PDT),Erik ,2016 Nissan Versa Note Hatchback 1.6 SV 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl CVT),Great for parking garage.," Forgive the wall, I'm on mobile.So got this as a rental, it looked cool and I wanted to try it. It had just over 2k milkes and I put 350 miles on it. Did a bit of city ( vegas!!) freeway and some ""mountain"" driving.   Let's point out the Pros of this. The blue tooth is simple and easy, and you can take it a step further by downloading an app. But I just used Google maps, which only works if you have the stereo on Bluetooth mode) Its great for parking, tight turns, great for those u turns, braking, and decent fuel economy. The steering response is middle of the road, maybe a bit above because the car doesn't roll if you have to jerk it over to the next lane. It does have a back up camera and you can see all around when in traffic. I didn't get a chance to see how well The traction control worked. The A/C did okay for 110F heat and no window tint. Meaning it was on full blast 95%, even when it was under 100F. The audio system sounded better then I imagined! Weaving in and out of traffic is a breeze, and you'll have plenty of room. Its not the ugliest or boring for a compact. There was plenty of room for just the two of us.  The dash is nice to look at and the double glove box was very convenient. Heck the knee one was very deep. Seating was firm but comfy. Combine the seating and suspension for a sporty feel.     Now the cons; even if you are at the front of the line at a stop light, you'll be last. Not only is take off unnaturally slow, the actual throttle response is about a whole second behind. Then after that you'll start to crawl forward ( no need to worry about burn outs!)  This can actually be annoying because if traffic speeds up a tad while rolling down the road it'll be a few before you'll catch up. It was amazing that it could go 70mph ( okay there were times we may have went 85mph but we were just keeping with the flow!! And the ride was challenging due to the swaying. Well get to that later) Imagine you are getting on the freeway, you hit the Apex and pin the throttle, the rpms jump up and as need to start merging, desperately, you look down and realize you are only doing 55-60mph, pending if the hill was in your favor. Okay you get it, accerleration is not what this car is meant to do. But you may think this can hold its speed. I mean come on, it's modern, it has a CVT, and it's small! Well sure it can. But only if it's minor. If you start climbing a little it'll rev up. And if it's a 6% grade, you might want to take the slow lane with the truckers.  So how does it handle? Well on a flat road it's perfect, that goes for the pavement. If it's concrete with slits you'll start swerving like a tractor trailer with high cross winds, sad part is it's only a slight over exaggeration. At around 50mph it becomes noticeable. Maybe it's a safetly feature to keep you paying attention!  I too thought maybe someone hit something. But seeing another versa I had to follow and see if they did the dance, and they did.  With all the negative I wrote, I really do not hate this car!  Sure it's gutless, the road surface can be a challenge, and the suspension is borderline cheap feeling, but it was fun! The only way I would own this was if I got it with 6sp and 30 more ponies.

We just wanted one for our local driver (4-6K miles a year) to replace our 15 year-old Camry. I first considered buying new for $20,000 off MSRP ($10,000 Fed/State tax credit and $10,000 dealer discount)  bringing an SV or SL model down to $16 - $18K, but that was really more than I wanted to pay for a light local driver.  I never found a $33K S model listed for $10,000 off MSRP, otherwise I may have bought a 2017 for $13K. In the end, I opted for a one owner, off lease, 2015,  with 27,000 miles, 12 bars, and certified by the dealer. The car is indistinguishable from new and cost $9300. I bought it for my wife,  but find I have been driving it a lot more than her, even though I am a big guy (6' 4"", 235) and love my 2013 Toyota Highlander Limited.

1319, on 08/09/17 13:23 PM (PDT),mike ,2017 Nissan Leaf Hatchback S 4dr Hatchback (electric DD),space ship 14 months of ownership/ gettin better.," The worst thing about this vehicle is resale value. You can purchase these vehicles for 1/3 the cost of new, but beware if you get the ""s"" model , you will not get the bigger battery unless it is a 2017 or newer. This larger battery will give you more range. My vehicle, which i have had just short of 3 months, has a range of 112+ miles with a full charge. The charge time is around 14 hours, depending on how much range was left on the vehicle at plug in time, and that is with the normal 110 volt household outlet. This vehicle, in my opinion is not great in any way, such as comfort, dependability, etc., but that it is not why I purchased this car. My goal was saving money on gasoline, oil, maintainence and in that regard it is a GREAT vehicle. It is the perfect car for the way I drive. This vehicle does not like freeways. The range drops whenever you engage the cruise control. The range shrinks much quicker as you increase your speed. However, if you drive the city streets, it is the complete opposite. For example, I drove 18 miles for a doughnut  craving. I had a full charge (115 miles on that day) and when I hit the store I only had 88 left. I drove the return trip on the city streets and when I got back to my driveway, I had 91 miles of range. Yes, that is not an error. I actually gained 3 miles. This was with my vehicle in B mode. That mode is 1 of 2 forward modes the transmission allows. The D mode is the default mode when you shift into forward gear. To get into B mode you double shift. This gives your braking system more regenative power. So, as you drive you charge the battery whenever you release the accelerator or apply the brakes. The range increase is real. I can charge to full and not need a recharge for many days, in spite of making  multiple 20 plus mile trips. In this regard the vehicle is fantastic. In most other area, it is just adequate. It has sufficient comfort in the cabin, enough to allow my wife to be comfortable in it, despite a bad back. The airconditioner is above average, blowing extremely cold after just a minute or two. The back seat is adequate for my 16 year old average size grandson. The rear hatch cargo area is, however, small. Still, to this point, I have not had a problem bringing home the groceries. The cars styling is a bummer. I have plastered a alien sticker on the roof area behind the rear door and have proclaimed the car my ""space ship"". I did not purchase the vehicle for looks. My youngest daughter thinks it is ""cute"". My oldest daughter enjoyed driving it and I think they both are interested in buying one. They have asked me how much it has increased my electric bill and I can honestly say after getting two electric bills since I took possesion, it was less than a couple of dollars more. Maybe I just haven't had the vehicle long enough to evaluate that because even I feel the increase should have been larger, but at this point, it is what it is. The ride of the vehicle is smooth and rattlefree. I have heard the brakes do not feel normal on these electrics. I find them no different then the Cruze that I drove before. I perfer this vehicle over the Cruze in most catagories. I have not used the higher watt chargers that are available to the public so i can't comment on that. Likewise on the heated seats, haven't used them. The sound system is average. I have heard the range drops in the colder months of winter. I will update as my experience broadens. As of now, I am thrilled with the car. It fits into my lifestyle perfectly and using it allows me to put less mileage on my vw van which I take on vacations and for hauling larger items. The addition of a second vehicle makes owning this vehicle a no brainer. Also, the $7500 tax credit makes this car a good value. I was able to get $12K off the sticker at the dealership. Extremely happy with my purchase. UPDATE, I have now driven the car for 7 plus months. My mileage is now at 3789. The cost of driving the car averages $20 per month in AEP electric bill increase. The winter weather does degrade the battery, but only by 10 or so less driving distance. The heated seats are not as warm as the ones in my vw van, but do allow some comfort. Using the heater is a big drag on the driving distance. In a conventional car, once your car warms up you have constant heat on demand. The  Leaf gives heat differently. It requires a warm up time each time you push  the heater button. Also, increasing the temp does not increase your battery drain, so crank it up. When you turn off the heater, close the vents or you will get cooler air coming into the cabin. I have noticed that the initial drop in range does not continue to deteriorate IF DRIVING ON CITY STREETS. However, the combination of using the heater AND freeway driving zaps the battery very severely. Expect to get less than half of displayed mileage. Another negative is because  of the design of the back of the vehicle, this area seems to collect dirt. I clean the back window often.",5.0,Nissan,Leaf,2014,electric,,0,DIRECT_DRIVE,FWD,4,Compact,Hatchback,101,126,2009,35020,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,2014 Nissan Leaf 4dr Hatchback FWD (0cyl)

Gives the car much better pick up that most compeitors. Amazing milage well over 30 mpg. Super comfortable seats. More than enough room in front and back for almost any size adult.  Great sound system on the base. Nice quite ride despite what critics say about CVT noise. It's only noisy if you rev the engine up to 4000 rpm or so. Handling is above average at best but very smooth effortless power steering. Only complaints are some weird noises this car makes. You can hear the gas slosh around the gas tank if you break hard. And the power steering pump constantly hums. Just pet peeves that don't really affect the cars drive ability. Overall it's every bit as good as a camry or sonata. Just depends on what you prefer.

What really sold me on the Armada is the torque and horsepower along with the outside restyling and posh looking interior. The 0-60 time on this vehicle is faster than most cars!

1352, on 06/05/16 05:55 AM (PDT),Frank ,2016 Nissan Versa Sedan 1.6 S 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Excellent for the money," The good: Great price, I paid under $10,500 out the door (tax, license, etc not included).  I paid more for a 1991 Civic LX in 1990.  That Civic had electric door locks and power windows, but no ABS or airbags.I like the ride.  I wouldn't call it plush, but certainly comfortable for a small car.  I find the car fairly quiet ... I don't have problem with using the phone when driving at highway speed. The 5MT and engine provide acceptable power ... I don't notice the problem going up hills the professional reviews have commented on.  The big mile-long hill near me I go up in 5th without losing speed although I do have to hit the gas.  Gas mileage is excellent ... getting higher than advertised if I don't roast it.   The manual transmission and clutch are really smooth and easy to use.  Long throw, but the clutch engagement is really light.  Easy to drive.  I like the steering ... it is quite strongly assisted, but it is easy to turn the wheel.  I can see how some prefer more feel, but this doesn't bother me.  The trunk is huge.  There is a donut spare, but it looks like there is room for a full size spare.  There wasn't in my 1991 Civic ... I did buy the full sized spare for that car but it didn't fit in the well. For this Versa, a full size spare would definitely fit. Hands free phone works great; connection with my android was painless.  With the aux in and a $5 lighter-USB adapter, I play music on my phone no problem.  I haven't used my CDs since ripping them, but now they have a use.  The styling of this car is nice.  Expert reviews bitching about a lack of soft touch plastic inside are a laugh.  Who said soft touch plastic is the best?  I can guarantee you the hard plastic used in the Versa S is more durable than ""soft"" thin skin plastic over polyurethane ... and what are the reviewers doing touching the plastic inside anyhow?  Shouldn't they also note the taste of this plastic isn't as good as much more expensive cars too? There is a remote trunk release inside the cabin ... some reviews say there is not.  Car comes standard with nice Continental tires.  The FM radio reception is quite good; controls on the steering wheel are convenient.The bad: The display (mileage, miles left in the tank, trip, etc) could be better ... you have to choose displays so I can't see trip and total miles or miles per tank on the same display.  There is a tachometer, but only idiot lights for everything else. Not much adjustment for the seat, but it does fit me quite well.  The steering wheel does adjust up and down.The rear seat backs don't fold down on this model.  Rear brakes are drum. Storage is limited.  Although the glove compartment is huge (non locking), other than this, cup holders in middle and on doors, and a small slot between seats that is too small for my Nexus 6P, there is no storage.  A space for quarters or storage of little things would have been nice.   The ugly:  No automatic door locks takes some getting used to.  The locks are a bit more difficult to actuate than they should be.  Only one door lock on the driver side ... lets hope it never goes bad.  OTOH, I just leave the car doors open with nothing of value inside.  Most thieves don't look at the cheapest new car sold in America thinking there must be a lot of valuables inside.

I look at several sites that provide professional reviews and see this car at or near the bottom.  I wanted an inexpensive commuter car with good gas mileage, hands free phone, the ability to play music on my phone, and this car fits the bill nicely.  It has hard plastic inside ... oh boo hoo.  If this is what you have to complain about, things are looking pretty good.  Cars costing thousands more have more features ... duh.  More than a year on I still love this little car, but understand the difference between the stick and CVT versions ... the stick is what I have and recommend.After 20 months, I still love this car.Update 2 years and 35K miles. There isn't another Nissan I'd buy ... you want to trade my 5MT Versa for your CVT Maxima?  Not a chance. Americans are missing out with their love affairs with CVT & other automatic transmissions. Gas mileage is 33-38 depending on how fast I'm going. Roll down windows and manual locks take a second more to use than electric. My Continental tires are worn close to the limit after 35K miles so I'm thinking of switching to Michelins.  But no, I wouldn't trade this car for anything with an automatic, even a Porsche.

But now, after 1300 miles, the experience keeps getting better.  Being 4'11"" is always a challenge but the seat and steering wheel easily accomodate me.  And the side mirror doesn't block my view when making left turns - that is not the case in the Audi Q5 which I also considered. I can see all around which was a problem in the BMW X6 which has a rear window that left me with huge blind spots. The best comfort feature is the vented seats.  In a black with black interior, the vented seats cool quickly and keep me cool on hot summer days. The only nit I have is that the Apple Car Play doesnt always turn on when I plug in my iPhone 6. Although it isnt an issue if my husband plugs in his iPhone 6S. I have one warning, it is easy to go very fast and not realize it. 50 feels like 35. 90 feels like 70.

The M series may be different. The Porsche excels with handling speed and comfort. The car has been in for service due to brake booster issues (vacuum leak) at 30k miles and routine maintenance.

This is my daily drive, as such, economy & reliability were important considerations. I constantly  obtain 31/32 MPG at 80+ MPH. In spite of  consistent reviews that claim the base engine lacks power, I find the 275 HP adequate and the base Cayman a blast to drive on open roads. The base engine would most likely lack required power to be competitive in a high performance track race, especially when powering out of turns for maximum lap times, but since I'll never get it on a race track, shes plenty fast. The PDK  transmission maximizes the cars performance, it's split second shifts can't be matched by man. I got the standard 18"" wheels & passed on every other option other than navigation, comfort pkg & sport steering wheel. After adding transportation fees and a clear bra I wangled a deal of $56,000 plus tax&license. I've had the car 7 months & 5,000 miles with no issues or regrets.  If your thinking about a sports car, I would strongly recommend the base Cayman with PDK as a consideration. As of mid April 2017, I  have nearly 8,000 trouble free miles on my base Cayman. On my latest weekend trip it got a whooping 33.6 MPG at 80/85 MPH!! The only negative is the cost of maintenance, the 1st oil change ran nearly $350!!! I'm told the 2nd service will be nearly $750.00 AND the 4th or 40,000 service is an astronomical $1500!! These are little mentioned details not provided by Porsche dealers during the buying experience. I do love the car, so I'll pay  & hopefully keep it 10 years. Just a reminder, mine is a 2016 model with the 2.7 liter six cylinder. The new  2017 Porsche Cayman's are now designated 718 models and have new 4 cylinder turbo charged engines, a design that's yet to be proven.It's now April 2018, I have 11,000 miles on the odometer without a hitch. All the hype about the base model with 275 HP being slow, is strictly MFG spin to get  buyers into high end models for more profit with a chance to visit your local jail. My battery was marginal so the dealer installed a new one under warranty. The car is all I expected EXCEPT for the cost of maintenance. The 10,000 mile service did cost $350.00, & the 2 yr (or  20,000 mi) service cost me over a grand and now I understand the 40,000 mi service is nearly TWO GRAND!!!

The gallop between 80 mph and 110 mph is intoxicating.  It accelerates assuredly and smoothly, and its reflexes are truly sports car athletic.  The interior is very comfortable and well appointed, and for less than $70,000, the car is an amazing value.  People say that  the trunk space is limited, but honestly, I have done a couple of Costco runs, and trips to the airport with luggage, without too much of a problem.   The top goes up and down in a matter of seconds -- and on the go when you are pulling out -- easy and convenient.  One thing -- at least in LA -- the car gets a lot of attention.  Between its looks, and the sound of the engine, the Boxster turns a lot of heads.  Now, that could be a good thing, or a bad thing.

I drove both S and base cars, thinking that I would surely want the S: I was wrong. The base car does not have, as the Edmunds ""con"" headline asserts ""mediocre acceleration"". It may be somewhat slower than the S version, but it is far more than adequate for normal use. In fact, it is faster than the 2006 Cayman S that I once owned. 
The one option that I recommend as essential is the PDK transmission, which is a remarkable unit. Those who insist on having a manual six-speed are making a mistake.
In the recent past I have had several versions of the Cayman, a Audi TT RS and a Corvette GS. The Boxster is superior to all

What I can say is that this is one fine, well-built, high performing vehicle. This car simply attracted me, especially after I couldn't find much else that appealed to me. Several makes and models seemed to be going for luxury at the expense of performance. I've always preferred cars that I drove, rather than ones that drove me. And those were getting increasingly difficult to find. I've always driven manual transmissions, and several ""sport sedans"" and even ""sport cars"" were abandoning them. So I plunked down a deposit in mid-July, knowing I wouldn't get it until around the first of December. It was worth the wait. Is the Porsche 718 Cayman inexpensive? No. But it's also not cheap, either. This is a well put together car with very good materials. It has an intelligent layout that is pretty darn intuitive and easy to understand. It has the smoothest shifting of any of my previous ten cars. I'd always wondered if a car can really feel like ""it corners on rails""; now I know one can. The handling of this car, and its responsiveness, is what I'd dream about if I dreamed about ""the ultimate car."" I wanted a car that would be just plain fun to drive on meandering country roads, and now I've got it. We've all had that one car we felt connected to - I had mine in my late 20s. But this Cayman looks like it will rival, and likely surpass, that connection. I suspect that in a very short time I will know what the car will do, and it will know what I'm up to. I've only had that one other car that generated that level of trust. And the look of this car is stunning (and with better lines than the previous Caymans). Also, a plug for Sun Motor Cars in Pennsylvania, an excellent dealership, is in order. So let's sum it up: looks, handling, the fun quotient, comfort, acceleration, a (gasp!) car with a manual transmission, that feeling of connection, a car that exudes thoughtful class and excellence - yes, this new Cayman checks all the boxes for me.

A couple of long road trips with and without the luggage carrier on top. (We got about 28pg highway)  The road noise is louder than I'd expect.  The acceleration is SLOW, but is steady and isn't that big of a problem once you get used to it.  Just don't jump out in heavy traffic, give yourself some room.  The active safety ""eyesight"" is a love hate relationship.  If you're following someone faster on the freeway you can set your cruise to 90 and it'll just maintain the speed and appropriate distance from the vehicle in front of you, which is nice.   The lane sensors on the side view mirrors seem to work well, although they take a little getting used to.  It is comfortable enough, although nothing I'd shout about.  We did drive for several hours on the highway with up to 6"" of snow before the plows came and had no problems, although we were only going about 35mph.  It handled snowy driveways with some elevation change just fine as well, nothing crazy. The car is roomy enough and it's easy to get a car seat in and out of the back.  There's also enough room in the cargo area to put the dog (we keep her on a doggy car harness tethered to the rear cargo hook) and a large stroller with no difficulties. The comfort level of the seats is adequate with nothing to complain about or rave about.Now for my complaints.  The entire electronics package sucks.  I hate it.  Nothing is intuitive.  I'm comparing this to both a BMW, where I can control everything with one little knob in the center console, and a dodge ram, which is super simple and intuitive.  Changing anything requires a lot of taking your eyes off the road.   The clock is tiny and requires looking at the console a couple of times to find where it is (it's my wife's daily driver, not mine).  I had to pull over and screw with the radio for several minutes to figure out how to manually change a station, it only wanted to work on pre-sets.  The voice commands are horrible.  If you want to input something in the navigation, forget it.  It requires pulling over.  My wife driving and me entering an address.... not a safety issue.  Maybe subaru should change the sensor and let you put in the address on the go if there is someone in the passenger seat.

Big mistake. The 2017 is terrible compared to the older model. Yeah, it's got a few nice improvements: shark-fin antenna instead of plastic rod (but reception is rather poor), rear backup camera, LED lighting....but the list of what Subaru totally screwed up (in my opinion) is too long to ignore. This is supposed to be a sports car, yet it resists acceleration. Yep, this car is S L O W. It accelerates like a tractor. The standard OEM navigation map is now gone, leaving a large dead area on the dash where a touch screen sits unused. The outside temperature and MPG readings are now buried within a multi-page small digital screen on the dash. The Blue Tooth will not maintain a connection to my iPhone and I've given up re-pairing it every few days. The steering wheel feels like cheap hardened foam compared to the nicer 2013 wheel. Doors don't automatically lock when you start driving as on other makes of cars. You cannot arm the security alarm with doors or trunk open because the alarm will then set off when closing them. The door handle sensor for locking the car hardly ever works, and the sensor for unlocking the car only unlocks the one door rather than the whole car (you need to manually press an unlock button inside to release the other side door). The Home Link auto-dimming rear view mirror still does NOT auto-dim (same poor technology as the 2013, yet Ford has an auto-dimming mirror which does work nicely so it's not unrealistic to expect this to actually work). The Home Link mirror buttons (which still do not work) have been moved from a more-convenient front location to an idiotic non-visible Bottom location. The rear seating area is smaller than the 2013, which was already cramped, so the back seats are pretty much just for show - my kid doesn't even fit back there comfortably so forget about seating 4 adults in the car. Add to all that various rattles and vibrations which just should not be happening on a factory-ordered brand new car. Even the pearl blue color isn't impressive - it's blue, but there really isn't any ""pearl"" look to it at all.

They succeeded, but the cheapness can come back to bite long-term owners. I have daily-driven the car for a year and 14,000 miles, so I have had the proper seat time to write a review. The two companies decided to put the whole budget into the drivetrain. My car in this respect has been solid. I replaced the transmission, differential, and engine oils myself, and the engineers really put a lot of thought into how to do that easily. On the flip side, most nuts and bolts on this car are made out of very weak metal, leading to all the wheel studs being stripped in just a few changes. The interior rattles like crazy, the speakers buzz at higher volumes, which are needed because of loud road noise. I had two sets of tail lights leak, and my headlight ballasts went out and needed replacement. The list goes on. The car will continue to drive and handle beautifully, but the non-essentials will entropy around you. The maintenance bill won't be in the thousands, but I have constantly had $100 here and there to replace the cheap parts. I am 6'2"" and 190 pounds and am triangle-shaped. Think broad shoulders and small waist. This car's seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat in. I want these for my office, house, and every car afterward. That being said, if I was an inch taller or 20 pounds heavier, I would hate them. All of my 'larger' friends hate riding in the car. My wife is tall and thin, and she hates hunching over to get in/out of the passenger side. Holding on to the steering wheel makes the driver's side easy. People like to say this car is slow. For muscle-car owners who love straight line speed, this car is not for you. I don't want any more power out of it, because I get to floor it during daily driving, and I don't get speeding tickets. It's exhilarating without being too dangerous. Countless journalists have raved about the balance and steering - all I know is that the car feels super secure going 30+ mph over suggested speed limits on turns. If I was looking at a BRZ and similar cars today, I personally would just save my money and buy a Mazda Miata RF. That being said, I still roll the windows down on a warm day and just go for a drive to relax.

Coming from a 99 528i bmw, and a 99 jeep cherokee (for deep snow and 4x4 jaunts)  I was skeptical of the claims of a good handling SUV, with good ground clearance, and the ability to tow more than 1000lbs.  All the claims are true,  while not a bmw,  this little crossover approaches the road quite well, steering is responsive, and body roll is minimal.   as well as being able to tackle small offroad obstacles.  mostly unimproved roads, with medium rocks, ruts, and shallow mud.    I have put over 60k hard miles on this little suv, and towed a camper, and an enclosed trailer with two sport ATV's.  both of which are over the recommended trailer weight rating (3000lb and 2800lb respectively)  I liken it to a dual sport motorcycle. while not great on the road, nor great off road,  the compromises are worth it.  with the extreme duty I have put this rig through, there have been a few hiccups.  I have had to at 40k replace all the brakes, and at 82k (now) had to replace the clutch throw out bearing, lower control arm bushings, and all the idler pulleys on the engine.  mostly due to offroad use, and towing a trailer.    other downsides of the base model are smallish brakes, which on road, and with modest spirited driving are adequate.  however are very under powered while towing a trailer over the manufacturer rated 1000lbs.  They are, however adequate to good with trailer brakes and required brake controller.   I have yet to see a ""stupid"" problem with this SUV.

1418, on 03/10/16 08:10 AM (PST),Christopher ,2016 Subaru WRX Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Can't Find Much to Like," I hate this car.  Maybe I'm just too old (55), but I struggle to find anything I like about it.  OK, the handling is definitely great, and the climate control, too, but that's about it really.  The acceleration, while good, is uneven and falls off suddenly at higher RPMs.  But even that is OK, it's just everything else.  Most of my complaints are small issues, but when added up  just make for a crappy experience, especially considering this is a 30k-ish car in premium trim like mine.  My biggest gripe is comfort.  I heard nothing but good things about the seats when reading reviews, but they just don't work for me.  I've had chronic neck and shoulder pain since the day I bought it. The arm rest with the extension and heated seat switch positions are a ridiculous afterthought.  Add to that, that the engine races when started cold, even on warm days, and takes a long time to settle into a solid normal idle, the clutch feel is poor  (I've driven sticks all my life, I know), the transmission is reluctant (maybe it's the STI short throw in mine) and sometimes will not go into first when the light turns green leaving you screwing around letting the clutch out and retrying.  The interior materials are pretty substandard, it's ride overly harsh (they should save that for the STI), lots of road noise, and perhaps worst of all is the stereo, so you can't even drown out all the annoyances with some good music.  I'll close with the comment that my 16 year old Jetta GLX was a better car in every respect except acceleration (not that bad with the vr6) and handling (too soft). I really miss that car... Be warned, this is not an enjoyable daily driver.[12/19/16] Update.  After trying to live with this for a year, I finally sold it.  I never warmed up to this car, and never looked forward to driving it.  The transmission shifting that I complained about was the only thing that improved with time.  That said, after about 1000 miles the throwout bearing started making noise on cold mornings.  Reading up on that issue revealed comments that said ""they all do that"" and others that said they went to the trouble of trying to get it fixed, only to have it do it again in short order.  I totally lost confidence over that issue.  In spite of me saying I liked the climate control, that changed to not liking it when the weather turned warm.  On hot days It just continues to blast you with cold air, never seeming to get a clue when enough is enough.  I'd have to turn it up to 85 to get it to stop, otherwise it would just blast cold my whole 10 mile ride home from work.  Never had that issue with my VW, it would almost immediately start dialing it back automatically. One of the final ""last straw"" issues for me was when one cool damp day I left it out and the side windows were all misted - I thought, ""oh, I'll just roll the windows down to wipe them clean"".  Good luck with that, the windows in this piece of crap don't even touch the wiper trim.  I literally had to push out on the windows while rolling them down and up to try to get them to wipe clean.  Give me a freakin' break!  If you have ever had a nice car and you buy this, you will forever be disappointed.  I did have a happy ending, though. I managed to get out of the WRX and into a GTI for almost a wash due to the deep discounting at VW, and in the process picked up everything I was missing including leather interior, an awesome Fender stereo, push button entry/start, adaptive xenon lights, rain sensing wipers, etc, etc.  If you must buy a WRX, I would advise buying a base model, spending more for any higher trim level is a waste, and will not somehow transform it into a better experience.  It's like putting lipstick on a pig.

Overall, it is a well engineered Subaru.  It is a Subaru, so is a little hoppy--it isn't ever going to ride like a luxury sedan.Our car needed an alignment in the first 100 miles--when aligned it drives very well.  Dealer was embarrassed and very apologetic.  I recommend requiring your dealer to align any new car your purchase, regardless of brand.  And any dealer would sell tons more vehicles if they aligned every vehicle as it came off the truck.  There is nothing as sweet as a car that tracks right and hugs the road.The backup screen froze at 120 miles but Subaru had a full-blown recall on the basic head unit ready just five days from the incident.  Remember this is a brand new design throughout the vehicle, so glitches happen.  I was called within hours of the local dealer receiving the recall and they had the revised software installed minutes after I brought it in that evening.  We have not seen any sign of the problem since.Negatives:  -No place to put change for tolls.   -Lack of a CD player--they are hardly no longer in use.  CPAs, attorneys, use them.  Libraries use them for talking books.   -The rear deck is rather high, so visibility out the back is not very good.  Of course the camera makes up for that a lot.  -Power steering is slow to respond, much like a very large (think Cadillac) car might.

It is so well buttoned up it's almost too good to be true.  I am a car enthusiast and a researcher.  Before I bought this car, I made sure to research every possible make and model with the features I was looking for, as well as go and drive them.  I drove the Blobeye/Hawkeye STI's, Evo 7-10 Lancers, and Mazdaspeed 3 and 6.    I was looking for a reliable, safe, fun, AWD, 5/6MT, family-friendly, affordable four-door sports car.  It's a tall order, but it's exactly what I got out of my 2.5RS.  Sure, you can definitely find a faster car, but I haven't been in a car that pulls the same amount of G's in the corners - not to mention Subarus are like legos; if you want you can drop an STI engine in it for a really affordable sum.  I was surprised just how much I love the N/A EJ251 that comes stock in the 2.5RS.If you are looking into this car, you know what you want.  If you want the same thing I did, this is the car for you.  There are a few cons of course; there's a bit of wind noise/vibration, and the interior is a bit lackluster.  Those are my only complaints, and both of those can be fixed with a little deadening materiel, some higher quality fabrics, and some custom bits.I didn't want to make this review long, so in conclusion, everything about this car is about as perfect as you can get.",5.0,Subaru,Impreza WRX,2013,gasoline,265.0,4,MANUAL,AWD,4,Compact,Sedan,25,19,640,29295,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,2013 Subaru Impreza WRX 4dr Sedan AWD (4cyl)

1450, on 04/03/18 18:48 PM (PDT),Kevin ,2017 Toyota Corolla iM Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (1.8L 4cyl 6M),What a Lemon," I bought this new 5/17 with a 6 speed manual. I test drove many other cars from domestic and import manufacturers and decided that after my wife's good Corolla experience to mimic purchase. She has a 2014 with the CVT trans. Although in general I like the car for its hatch back, basic interior and reasonable road holding, driving this thing is the worst experience I have ever had. At 47 years old I have a CDL license and have owned and driven many cars, trucks, motorcycles and commercial vehicles with mostly good experiences. This car has some serious flaws with the manual trans and fuel programming which has made it dangerous for me to drive. For one thing it has an unstable idle at red lights. It will not settle down to about 750 RPMs, instead it roams from 400-800 and when it is dipped low I frequently stall it at lights trying to take off. Second, it has a hesitation off of idle which makes it difficult to feel for clutch engagement again when trying to take off from a stop. The result is either stalling again or slipping the clutch to the point I cannot see getting 50K out of this clutch. The fuel management is again flawed when accelerating beyond 3800k RPMs. This engine makes its highest torque at 4k and highest horsepower at about 5.4k. On my car when you hit 3.8k or higher RPMs the idle hangs at that RPM and will not lower for several seconds in between shifts. If you let the clutch out it makes the car jerk badly or you have to hold the clutch in until enough time evolves until the idle lowers to safely engage the higher gear. When trying to downshift there is great difficulty in revving the motor due to the  hesitation off of idle so again the car jerks badly due to too low of RPMs in the downshift. It has never produced any fault codes for these issues. When brought in for service the dealership here in Albuquerque, NM downplayed the issues by claiming it runs the same as another new car on the lot. Currently my car has 1.3k on it, it's not even broken in by a long shot. As others have noted the engine is extremely low powered and I feel well below the stated 136 HP and 126 Torque ratings. I did not buy it for as a sports car for sure. The brakes are somewhat spongy but according to the dealership all is well again compared to some other car. In retrospect I wish that I had not purchased this vehicle as there is no way I will be able to solve the fuel programming and idle issues  on my own and the lifespan of the clutch and transmission will be severely short lived due to Toyota's design.",2.0,Toyota,Corolla iM,2017,gasoline,137.0,4,MANUAL,FWD,4,Compact,Hatchback,35,27,2031,18750,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,2017 Toyota Corolla iM 4dr Hatchback FWD (4cyl)

Our feeling is that the management is profiting by diluting the quality of the brand.  The 2012 RAV4 is a relatively competent vehicle, in that it handles all kinds of weather with little drama. It also has large and flexible capacities to move people and goods and very good visibility.  The platform has not evolved over a decade of changing oil prices and it remains highly inefficient at 23 miles per gallon in combined driving over 36000 miles for the 4 cylinder model.  The 4 speed transmission belongs in the stone age.  The brand dilution is most notable in some of the interior materials and the quality of the electronic interfaces.  The seat materials in the base and sport models are poor.  The seats have relatively good padding but they will stain if water is poured on them inadvertently.  Either the company did not test the materials or is profiting from the sale of Scotchguard.   The arm rests on the doors are akin to sand paper in the summer; make sure when you test drive this car you do not have on heavy coats as this flaw will become apparent in the warmer months.  Most of the interior is lower quality harder plastics, which scratch with ease.  The stereo options are uninspired.

Purchased this new truck after 2 years of research on the SUV market.  Looked at the Audi Q7, Volvo XC90, Range Rover, Mercedes GL, Infiniti QX, and others.  Great tech in the Audi but all data on reliability and the data was was limited to 7 years.  Great tech in the Volvo XC90 but when you think of a 4 cylinder with a turbo charger and supercharger it is still a 4 cylinder engine pushing out that power and the strain it puts on the components is high.  Range Rover also beautiful and technologically advanced but I own a Jaguar already and don't need 2 high maintenance vehicles (don't get me wrong I like the smooth V8 but I keep my trucks a long time).  I had a 1999 Isuzu Trooper and it finally gave out after 18 years.  The Toyota Land Cruiser delivers smooth power quietly and the ride absorbs the bumps without jarring occupants, but keep in mind it is a truck.  Cabin is well insulated and keeps out the noise.  The fuel efficiency is less than desireable, recent 1200 mile road road trip I averaged 17.5 mpg (I-5 through northern CA).  In the city if I adjust my driving style can get 13.5 MPG.  Only maintenance I have had done is get the windshield replaced, on the road trip got a rock chip.  I have $0 deductible (lucky I switched), OEM glass is $900 and install another $200-300.  Then you have to get the sensors and cameras calibrated at the dealership which is another $130-180.  I have had OEE (Original equipment equivalent) glass and always could see imperfections, also with the tech I wouldn't go with anything but OEM glass.Update 5/22/2018:This truck has been a joy for our camping and snow adventures!  On one of our camping trips  I was coming down a hill and got the rear bumper snagged on a tree stump.  Popped the rear bumper cover off.  I was able to get it snapped back into place but it left a crack on the bottom.  It was a steep descent and I knew the stump was there but didn’t realize how soft the dirt was.  Estimate to replace is about $1100.  Also have upgraded the tires to BFG TAKO2 and increased the size to 32.5” and don’t have any rubbing.  Noticed some rough shifting when coasting to a stop and then starting to accelerate the shift is jerky at times.  Brought it to the dealership hoping for a fix but they said there wasn’t one.  I referred to a TSB and they said they would try to apply it but had to do a drive with the tech.  They applied it and it put it back into learning mode and it seemed smoother but once it learned seemed to revert back but to a similar behavior but not as severe.  Future plans are to upgrade the suspension next to OME-BP51’s but the OEM ride is supple and handles good for a truck of this size.

I had a Jeep wrangler unlimited and was looking for something comparable for the on and off road capabilities. Test drive after test drive I came to the 2016 4Runner and loved it. The off road technology and system the ride the comfort and safety features. There is a ton of storage and all kinds of nooks to store stuff as we as the back. As far as the reviews that say it is the same 4runner in a different look this is because why fix something that is not broken? Some manufactures change things every other year and they have problems after problems. The ride quality is what it is its a truck it is not a luxury car but it is not horrible IMO it rides smooth and very nice but I am coming from a Jeep but I love the ride quality.

I test drove the Corolla and thought I fell in love but felt it was too large for me. I was then shown the Yaris iA and I fell in love! It has a cute body style and is small enough to fit in any spot, yet still very spacious and comfy. The back seats do fold down and makes the trunk larger to hold more. My passengers have loved the space in the back seats and how the head rests moves to the individual sitting in that seat. The gas mileage is pretty accurate as I get 30 in city and 37 in highway. I can't complain because my previous car was getting between 16 and 20 mpg. This was a great investment and I absolutely love this car. It does not have an arm rest but you can buy a factory arm rest from Toyota and it snaps right in no assembly required. Also, there is no NAVI system so that's on the negatives.

1491, on 07/31/17 00:07 AM (PDT),Shawn ,2017 Toyota Yaris iA Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 6M),First thoughts of owning a Yaris IA," This review is being written after my first two days of owning the Yaris IA. I've driven hills, highways, and city. Only thing left is curvy mountain roads and inclement weather. Prior to owning this car I drove my friends 2015 Honda Civic LX Manual. So that is my comparison for the Yaris IA. -------------------------------------------------------------WHAT I LIKE - PRICE: It's a great car for a first time owner. I honestly don't believe you can do better for the price for how much the car provides. INFOTAINMENT: I've heard mixed responses on the Mazda style shift knob to control the music, etc. But I honestly love it. After a single drive I think all cars should be heading in that direction. I also really like the Display. Bright, crisp, with good customization. I think back to my buddys honda and I practically have a tv over his mini screen. INTERIOR: For the subcompact class I think this is where the Yaris really shines. The interior looks sleek and attractive with a good mixture of textures. I appreciate the blue/black schema as well. Only complaint is some clear areas that held together loosely. The middle console you can shift quite a bit if you're trying to. This however I don't think will ever come up during us so I'm not worried. MIDDLE ARMREST: This was a concern before I got the car. If it'd be comfortable with nothing to put my right elbow on during driving. However, even after a long drive, I found it hadn't bothered me at all. In fact, it felt very natural to rest my hand on the control for the infotainment system the whole drive. Surprised how natural that felt. HANDLING: The car does feel very responsive. I've been enjoying myself to say the least. FUEL ECONOMY: I'm currently averaging 34mpg with some aggressive driving. My buddies Honda doing the same drives averages 28mpg. That speaks enough right there. BACK UP CAM: Once again comparing to my buddies honda the camera on this thing is much brighter and more detailed. However, at night it becomes extremely pixelated and blotchy. Totally usable, but a noticeable drop in quality of image. Frankly, having a back up cam at this price at all is amazing, so still a plus. --------------------------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE: ACCELERATION: Admittedly I'm still getting used to the manual in this car but I'm having trouble getting this puppy going. Once I get up to about 2 or 3 things go just fine but the low end torque is nothing to be impressed by. BACKSEATS: I'm a personal trainer, I weigh 220lbs with broad shoulders at 5'11"". I'm a little above average but I do feel pretty big in this car. The front seats accommodate well enough but if you have friends taller than 5'8"" they will not be comfortable in the back. I mean, it's a subcompact, what do you expect, but damn. I put 3 friends plus myself in there and it was a clown car. FRONTSEATS: The side wings on the front seat don't feel immediately comfortable to me. It may be different for differently shaped people but for me it's like they're poking my sides. This however, is mediated. When I drive for a long time it doesn't become unbearable. It may just be a getting used to it thing since I don't even notice the seats after an hour drive. STORAGE: Now, trunk storage is fantastic. Don't worry about that. I don't think you can do better in this class. However, cabin storage like a middle divider is completely absent. Two cubbys and two cup holders. I'm having to get creative with where i store things like Loose change and gum. PAINT: Now, this isn't so much a concern now but I did see a review once saying the paint was cheap and chips easily. I'll have to see across the years that I own this. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL THOUGHTS: So, I just listed certain talking points that I know I want people to tell me about in their reviews. But, in the end, I'm loving this car. Having got it used for 14k with less than 2,000 miles on it I can't believe how much I'm getting for my money. I feel like I'm in a much more expensive car while in the interior and the driving experience is just fine as long as you're not drag racing. i honestly don't think you can do much better for the money. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will update this review in 6 months after I finish my first Maintenance.",4.0,Toyota,Yaris iA,2017,gasoline,106.0,4,MANUAL,FWD,4,Compact,Sedan,39,30,2031,15950,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2017 Toyota Yaris iA 4dr Sedan FWD (4cyl)

My strongest suggestion whenever you buy a car is to PERSONALLY write down the VIN# of the vehicle you are buying and check it against the one they put on your contract!! DO NOT trust the sales staff!! While they were shoving paperwork at me and the car had been taken to the prep area, they switched cars on me. The vehicle I drove off in looked identical to the one I thought I had purchased but it did not seem to have the same power. Since I was the last one out the door that Friday night and lived 300 miles away, I chose to return the next week upon my return to the area. That's when I discovered they had put the VIN# of the four-cylinder vehicle on my contract, which was what I drove home, instead of the six-cylinder one I thought I had purchased.     All that aside, for an underpowered vehicle she has done extremely well traveling upwards of 1500 miles a week on the I-15 corridor in Utah between St. George and Salt Lake City through the mountains and valleys, and changing the weather in between. The AWD has been most useful. When I first purchased the car she only got 12-15 mpg, while rated at 27mpg - SHOCKING! Through careful and proper maintenance I eventually raised it to 21mpg. Then I added a Hydrogen Assist Fuel Cell [HAFC] to the engine and that boosted me to 24-25. My only complaint is that the pedals are touchy. It's difficult to get smooth starts and stops.

I bought it used with 100k miles in Spring 2013 looking for a fuel efficient car to drive to college and back (650 mile trip one way).  I made this trip 24 times in subzero/rainy/snowy weather with no issues!  I averaged between 34-38.5 mpg highway at 75 mph and 26 mpg driving around town.  Very minimal maintenance with this vehicle, only issues was the heat shield came loose, an exhaust leak, and a rattling noise from the camshaft timing gear assembly (this was a known problem for 2009-2010 corollas, search TSB-0087-09).  Traction Control and Stability Control do very well in the snow controlling the vehicle.  When above 45mph there is a lot of wind noise, making you have to turn up the radio quite a lot to listen to music.  Cargo space is very great, I managed to fit all my apartment items in it.  Interior materials are very cheap and rattle occasionally.  Also, the front seats need LUMBAR SUPPORT!  My back ached after only an hour driving it.  The radio sometimes did not work on hot sunny days.  Unfortunately, when the vehicle approached 160k miles the transmission blew every gear!  Still do no know the cause (maybe excessive usage), but will now be looking at a newer Corolla with the 6 speed manual.  Without a doubt Corollas are reliable and efficient, yet at the cost of a more cheap, noisy vehicle experience.  If you are on a budget and care about getting from A-B with minimal fuel usage and cheap insurance, the Corolla is a great candidate!  2009-2013 Corollas are dirt cheap right now, so pick them up while you can!

The adjustments for the radio like the bass , and treble really don't work and the volume basically has to be between 20 and 30 to hear over road noise. You go to surround sound and there still is very little difference. So, needless to say the stereo system sucks. Also, they put LED headlights on the car and can't stand them. Needed special night driving glasses made because I get migraine from the reflection off signs and vehicles. On coming traffic always thinks you have your brights on and they continuously flash there brights at you. Don't have fog lights anymore that you can turn on or off by yourself either.

Super impressive Engine, performance and handling. I cannot fault anything on the car EXCEPT the JBL ""Premium"" Audio. It is utterly unacceptable and poor. The rear speaker has barely anything going to it, almost no bass, (or any sound at all) comes from the lower door speakers, I would say upwards of 90% of the sound, (bass included) is directed to the high in-dash speakers. Volume? With volume set at Max, you can hold a normal conversation in the front seats without raising voices. It is utterly pitiful. No power, no volume, no bass. During preparation for production, one person, somewhere in the Toyota organization, would have probably been responsible for making the decision to go ahead and include this system, and to label it as ""Premium Sound"". This person should be fired. Then the fact that somebody in Quality didn't listen to it and check it afterwards, baffles me. EVERYTHING about this car is excellent, except the music. Absolutely, buy the car (XSE V6), but be prepared to immediately get a stereo shop to rip out the pitiful, impotent sound system, and replace it with something louder than your average bedside clock/radio alarm clock.

We ended up test driving this one because it was at the lot next door and we feel just incredibly lucky that we did. We LOVE it. It's zippy and fun, with a crazy amount of cargo space (comparable or greater than most crossovers), and is very quiet and smooth to drive. We got the base model because it's already well equipped, and the quality of the interior for the price is just incredible. I discovered that we actually like to have a car with subtle, elegant styling, instead a tank that looks like it's ready to go mud slinging. One nice thing about this car is that my 6'1"" husband can sit in the backseat without his head touching the ceiling. Though he's not crazy tall, we've still found that to be rare. We got the TSI instead of diesel (the purchase was before the emissions scandal) because we found it was snappier.

I have had everything from a Ford Taurus to a Camarro and in 2013 I decided to get this vw Jetta. And it has been the worse decision of my life. I have had more problems with this one car and put more money into it then all of my cars combined. The transmission is horrible. The electrical in the whole car is absolutely horrible. My doors will not lock and sometimes will not unlock once I do get them locked. The Windows and sunroof will have problems closing.  The last problem that has put me over board is my key will get stuck in the ignition I have had to leave my car running over night until it just runs out of gas because I am not able to turn it off. On top of it running out of gas the battery will also die because the car will not shut off at all. When I do call or go into the dealer they say they can do nothing to help but sit there and jiggle the key until it will sometimes pop out. Multiple technicians at the dealer have told me that this happens to a lot of people and from the research I have done it happens to many people... Yet vw still doesn't make a recall on it or offer to fix this problem with no charge.  If I did want to get a new ignition it would be around 1000 dollars and it's still not guranteed to fix the problem cause it can just happen again and on top of that if the key happens to break while they are trying to pull the key out its not their problem and that will have to be replaced also.

At $160,000 I am selling the car for parts.  Two weeks ago I replaced the drive shaft, very common problem, expect to replace one every 50 to 60K miles.

Pulled the codes and found that I had a cam position error, this car has a chain not a belt, which should last at least 200K miles.  Started the car in the morning and it was running fine.  I got on the highway and got a low oil pressure, stop car immediately, warning on the dash.  Towed to mechanic.  Found that this car has problems with stretching timing chains, very common problem, expect to have on replaced before 180K miles.  Problem is that the timing chain is at the back of the motor.  Motor must be pulled to replace the chain $3000.  This engine also has a problem with oil pumps, $1200.  Car is now a throw away.  Over the past year I have also had window switch problems, typical.  Headlight intermittent issue, mechanic told me that he sees this on almost all of them, just hit it to have the light make contact.  Rear window would not open, and rear window defroster would not work.  Wiring harness was cut by the tailgate hinge, another common problem.

There are a lot of manufacturers out there, stay away from VW. My 2015 Touareg has transmission issues, and issues with the Infotainment Center. I actually backed into a car because the backup camera shut off as I was backing up. Bluetooth quality is poor. Transmission does not shift well at lower speeds.

Dealership told me too bad. :(Update: After having my car in for service 8 times, the dealership (VW Scottsdale) told me the transmission issue was between me and VW. I opened a case with VW corporate, the representative told me they were dealing with bigger issues and hung up on me, closed my case. The transmission was unsafe at times as it would not shift up or down when accelerating, it would clunk and jerk at times, other times it shifted ok. Bottom line was VW did not want to correct the issue. They also had not intention of fixing the infotainment system. It takes 4-5 minutes for the system to boot up. They told me the best they could do was to disable Sirius and that would help the boot process. The dealer (General Manager at VW Scottsdale) told me he would buy my car for $34,000. His first offer was $40,000, when I told him I would take it he reduced his offer to $38,000. When I complained he further reduced his offer. I have lost all confidence in VW, especially the VW Scottsdale dealership. I finally traded in my VW Touareg for a Ford F 150 (which I love!). I lost over $12,000 in owning the Touareg for 14 months.

We selected the Alltrack because it is AWD and is available with a manual transmission. We don't care about the supposed off-road capabilities. But we do live in the Colorado mountains and don't like getting stuck in the snow. For that purpose, this car is the perfect compromise because you don't give up good handling, economy, and comfort, which is what you need over 95% of the time.  With the manual transmission we are averaging 29mpg and expect to get in the 30s on trips (Fuelly.com shows that the DSG (automatic) Alltracks average about 3-4 mpg less). The stereo capabilities are impressive. We opted for the S model due to the added level of road noise, leaks, and breakage we experienced with the panoramic sunroof on our 2009 Sportwagen. This is my first VW without a sunroof since 1983 and I have no regrets about not having the panoramic sunroof. The manual transmission is geared toward fuel economy rather than performance, like  a GTI, but it is still a pleasure to shift. Between hill hold, optionally giving it the gas when starting to prevent stalling, turning off the gas when coasting in gear, and maintaining the cruise control when shifting, shows that VW has carried manual transmissions to the next level. Our biggest gripe was that we were waiting for the manual Alltracks to arrive and we afraid they wouldn't show until after our buyback, leaving us without a car. Luckily the new car showed up two weeks before the buyback.Update 06/27/18: My wife has driven the Alltrack about 2000 miles/month, so it now has over 30,000 miles in 15 months. I can not recall any issues. It has worked well for commuting and hauling. Using Thule square bar racks, stops, and straps, we have carried 8x4 plywood and drywall sheets, 7 foot tall bookcases, and most anything that doesn't fit inside. Being lower than SUVs makes it relatively easy to get big things on and off the roof rack. We use fuelly.com to track all gas usage and my wife continues to average 29-30 mpg in commuting and city driving. The oil filter being on top makes it a breeze to change the oil. We got a duplicate set of the stock wheels off craigslist and mounted 225/50-17 Artic Altimax snow tires on them. We live in the Colorado mountains and the Alltrack handles it well with its AWD and snow tires.

I have found the VW's six speed to be a superior transmission and when paired to the 1.8L Turbo, offers spirited acceleration when needed and excellent highway MPG's.  City mileage is average.  The power train is a smooth and quiet operator.  Ride in the Passat is at least equal to, if not slightly superior, to the Accords.  The Passat offers an ever so slightly firmer ride, which I prefer.  Neither the Accord nor the Passat are segment leaders in overall handling.  But, again, the Passat is at least equal to, if not a little bit better, than the Accord.  Overall driving dynamics in the Accord is softer than the Passat with more body lean in turns.

1578, on 03/26/17 11:36 AM (PDT),Jeff ,2015 Volkswagen Tiguan SUV S 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),List of problems with Tiguan," Here are the problems I have had with the Tiguan over the past two years which together make me believe that the car is unsafe to drive.The worst problem is that even at the highest setting, the windshield wipers are too slow.  This makes the car DANGEROUS in a heavy rain.  It is also tricky finding the shut off setting on the wipers and so it generally takes at least a couple of tries.   To add to the problem the headlights are too dim.  The dealer says they are okay but they aren’t.  The visibility to the right is poor if you are tall.  The seat does not go down far enough and so your view is obstructed to the right.  And if the backseats are in the up position, the rear view mirror is worthless because the head rests are too high. So we have the mid-section down all the time to see out the back.  But that kills a lot of space.  The head rests do not appear to be removable. All headrests are not comfortable for people who are 5'4"" or 6'0"" and they are hard and so even though the seats are otherwise quite comfortable, for a long trip, the car is not comfortable. The back seats only go down to about a 30 degree angle which means you lose a lot of what you thought was space for cargo.  Turning off the turn signal turns out to be a trick; you go all the way left and all the way right and eventually find the middle which turns it off; bad engineering.   The gas pedal is overactive and so there is a tendency to lurch forward.  The keys to the car have automatic locking (sometimes).  My car has been robbed twice because I thought it was locked and we come back all the time to find it is unlocked.  Again, the dealer could not find a problem.  The turning radius is pathetic; more like a truck.  Like other cars, the automatic windows are annoying because it takes an effort to open a window a crack (going all the way down and all the way up).  The red security light when the car is off is a tip off for car thieves.  Brilliant feature.  There is a ticking noise in the back that the car repair guys have no idea what it is but it is annoying on a trip.  The backup system is out of date already; not bad, but not good either.  The radio has Sirius and is otherwise too complicated.   The Bluetooth no longer works.  The gas indicator is fairly uniform until you get to the red zone.  Then you have 20 miles, but it looks like ¼ a tank on the dial. Learned this the hard way. The gas door rusts very easily.  You have to clean it every time but it is still rusting.  The rest of the car has not had that problem, but we don’t get salt on the car.  You have to go to a dealer to reset the warning messages on the dash even if it’s an easy fix.  Also some of the messages are big brother watching.   In the front seat console, the slots are too deep and narrow.  So you have to rent a 3 year old to get stuff out of there.",2.0,Volkswagen,Tiguan,2015,gasoline,200.0,4,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Compact,SUV,26,20,873,30225,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2015 Volkswagen Tiguan 4dr SUV AWD (4cyl)

Our wishlist criteria was AWD, decent gas mileage, reasonable price, safety, safety, and of course safety.  We looked at Nissan, VW, Toyota, BMW, Audi, Chevy, Ford, and Honda.  The Tiguan was the only small SUV we  tested that was not even available with any of the current safety technology.  We wanted active braking assist, lane departure warning, blind spot detection, cross traffic monitoring, rear camera, adaptive cruise control, etc...  Unfortunately, VW has deemed it unnecessary to offer any these features on this vehicle.  I guess our kids don't need safety features.  Other brands we looked at were nearly as bad, since they only offered the safety features on the high end models. Shame on them... to think less-affluent people don't deserve the option of safety features.  They require you to purchase all the high end whiz bang gadgetry before being eligible for safety features.  Supposedly, Honda is going to offer the safety suite on mid-level brands soon, but we don't have time to wait for that.  Fortunately, Toyota has pulled its head out, and now provides a nice suite of safety features standard on its Prius.

A few problems I've ran into is strictly with the dealership. When purchasing the base model we was told we could upgrade our stereo system to have navigation and XM radio added, after purchasing the car we took it back to have the upgrades service told us that it's not compatible? Another issue, my anti lock brakes are activating for no reason making it hard to stop its happened 3 or 4 times since I've owned it on smooth dry roads. Brought it to the closest dealership 30miles away for them to tell me they can't pull my warranty information I had to take it to the dealership I bought it from 50miles away. Why?? I've had it in the dealership 3times now for the antilock brakes and service says it's not throwing a code nothing is wrong with it bring it back when it happens again..  Some pro's about the Tiguan I really like how the car handles and the fwd does  excellent in snow. MPG is great! I average about 29mpg combined (better than advertised).I like that the base models comes loaded. Heated leatherette seats, heated mirrors, push button start, kessy, auto headlights, rain sensing wipers, Bluetooth and back up camera.

The stock stereo is great, it rides and drives like a Golf, the interior is well thought out and feels much higher quality than its price would imply. Not sure if VW rates their engines at the wheels but every FWD model I've seen dyno results on matches VW's power output claim, so in reality the engine is likely putting out 230+hp and 240+lb-ft, and it feels like it. I'm coming from a modified, 400hp Taurus SHO so I was expecting a huge let down. I'm quite happy with the getup and go this car has. I'm also averaging 20.5 mpg in the city (actual city) and 28 on the highway with cruise at 75. Now for my complaints: no satellite radio on the base model. Seriously? Almost everyone else has that. As a satellite radio subscriber this let me down, but not enough to outshine the merits of the rest of the carTrunk is small. Very small. Like can't fit my collie mix comfortably in the back with the rear seats fully reclined.

Our only complaint is how hard it is to keep the car clean!",5.0,Volvo,XC60,2015,gasoline,325.0,6,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,24,17,870,51050,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,2015 Volvo XC60 4dr SUV AWD (6cyl)

Get an average ofabout 25 miles a gallon.  One thing I don't like is you can't get the transmission fluid changed as its self contained. Would have it done at 30k If I could have. No issues though. Looks great to me and goes through a ton of snow with no issue.",5.0,Volvo,XC60,2016,gasoline,250.0,5,AUTOMATIC,AWD,4,Midsize,SUV,26,19,870,38100,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,2016 Volvo XC60 4dr SUV AWD (5cyl)

It's fast, comfortable and handles great. Just got back from a 5 hour trip to Boston and the comfort of the seats held up the entire trip and I averaged 29 miles per gallon. The exterior continues to attract attention and turn heads.

My 2011 C30 is refreshing and my passengers love the upgrade. It is the perfect car for me. I am in my early 30's married with no children, so I rarely have back seat passengers (a must for this car). This car so sophisticated with out being boring or stuffy.
